## [3.25.0] - 2026-06-11

### Full-System Audit & Stability Overhaul (Build 403)

A 116-agent audit (static analysis + adversarial verification + live QEMU
testing) produced 140 findings (97 confirmed, 25 observed dynamically). This
release fixes the confirmed critical/high findings across the scheduler,
window manager, event system, input drivers, graphics, and boot chain. Full
details: docs/AUDIT-HANDOFF-2026-06.md (handoff summary) and
docs/audit-2026-06-digest.md (every finding with verified patches).

### Fixed - Crashes & Memory Corruption

- **win_create drew its resize-grip pixels into the KERNEL CODE segment**
  (ES never set to video memory in win_draw_stub's grip block) — for some
  window geometries (e.g. 160x100) the four grip dots read-modify-wrote live
  kernel instructions; apps calling API 22 directly sprayed their own
  segment. Root cause of "random" crashes and corrupted window handles.
- **fat12_read popped one word too many** at .not_supported (7 pops for 6
  pushes) — any FAT12 read at file position != 0 returned through a
  corrupted stack and jumped to garbage. Also added a zero-byte/EOF fast
  path so read-until-0 loops terminate.
- **Kernel load was at 100% capacity with zero growth headroom** — kernel
  area expanded from 88 to 104 sectors (52KB) across the whole chain
  (stage2, BPB reserved sectors 94→110, add_floppy_fs.py, mkboot, fat12
  mount offsets — which were hardcoded, not BPB-derived). The kernel image
  pad now fails the build if the kernel outgrows the area.
- **ES was not part of the task context** — clobbered across every
  yield/context switch; cross-task segment corruption for any app holding
  ES across a syscall. Saved/restored on all five context paths.
- **Stale INT 0x80 dispatcher flags survived RETF app exit** — the next
  task resumed with the dead app's coordinate-translation/cursor-lock
  state, corrupting its registers. Flags now consumed one-shot.
- **mkboot wrote a stale filesystem size** (2810 sectors, three layouts
  old) — now derived from the layout constants.

### Fixed - Window Manager (create/destroy/z-order verified)

- **Z-order values drifted to 0 and collided** — every create/focus demoted
  all windows but destroy never renormalized, so after ~7 launch/close
  cycles hit-testing, painting, and promotion disagreed about stacking.
  Focus now demotes only windows above the raised one; destroy closes the
  z-gap. Invariant: visible windows hold dense distinct z {16-N..15}.
- **win_resize repainted only the desktop** — shrinking a window erased
  any window it overlapped. Now uses redraw_affected_windows like move.
- **win_focus (API 23) raised windows logically but never repainted** —
  stale title-bar states, stale pixels on top.
- **Resize-handle hit-test ignored occlusion** — clicking the body of a
  topmost window could start resizing a window underneath it.
- **Z-clipped WIN_REDRAW events left permanent holes** in background
  windows; **window titles overwrote the [X] close button** (now clipped).
- destroy_task_windows batches its repaint instead of a full
  promote/focus/redraw cycle per window.

### Fixed - Input & Events

- **post_event had no interrupt masking** — task-context posts raced
  IRQ1/IRQ12 posts and silently lost keystrokes/clicks exactly when window
  activity coincided with typing. Now pushf/cli...popf protected.
- **Single global event-queue head caused head-of-line blocking** — one
  task's pending event stalled keyboard/mouse for every task, then the
  31-slot queue filled and dropped input. event_get now forward-scans with
  tombstones; consecutive mouse events are coalesced at post time.
- **event_wait (API 10) / kbd_wait_key (API 12) busy-waited without
  yielding** — one blocked task froze the whole cooperative system.
- **Scancode table read out of bounds** for scancodes 0x60-0x7F.
- **XT (8255 PPI) keyboard acknowledge was missing** — on a real PC/XT the
  keyboard died after the first keystroke. Port 0x61 bit-7 pulse added.
- **Arrow/nav keys required E0 scancodes XT keyboards never send** —
  NumLock-aware routing of bare numpad codes 0x47-0x53 to the special-key
  map; NumLock toggle tracked, seeded from the BIOS flag byte.
- **IRQ12 swallowed keyboard bytes** when the KBC AUX bit was clear; mouse
  packet stream now self-heals after a lost byte (idle re-arm + sync-bit
  rejection); event_get no longer clobbers CX/DX on the no-event path.

### Fixed - Graphics (visual anomalies)

- **Default 8x8 font had a 12px advance** — all default text 50% wider
  than intended; primary cause of the boot-visible overlapping desktop
  icon labels (plus 10-char label truncation in launcher + kernel).
- **CGA scroll clear-all path fell through into VESA bank-switching code**
  — garbage fills + undefined INT 10h calls in the default video mode.
- **VESA scroll corrupted rows straddling 64KB bank boundaries**;
  vesa_fill_rect skipped a bank when a row started exactly on a boundary;
  vesa_set_bank now honors the VESA window granularity.
- **Glyphs bled up to 7px past window borders** — draw_char/draw_char_inverted
  now enforce the clip rect at row/pixel level (char & wrap APIs included).
- **gfx_blit_rect copied forward regardless of overlap** (smearing) and
  produced black fills in VESA/mode-12h (read_pixel unimplemented there).
- CGA fill/clear fast paths gained screen-bounds clamping; CGA scroll no
  longer smears up to 3 pixel columns outside non-4-aligned regions.
- VESA mode queries no longer clobber the system clipboard at 0x9000:0.

### Fixed - Desktop

- Kernel desktop icon table sized for the launcher's 40 icons (was 16) with
  bounds-checked registration; icon names NUL-terminated; label dirty-rects
  sized to real label width; icon 0 selected at boot.

### Performance

- gfx_fill_color CGA path: hybrid fill (masked edges + rep stosb middle)
  replaces per-pixel plotting for misaligned fills — ~10-40x faster window
  repaints in the default mode (partially applied; see handoff doc).
- 8px font advance removes the 4-gap-pixel-per-char fill (~33% fewer plots
  per character system-wide).

### Tooling & Tests

- tools/qemu_test.sh: headless QEMU driver (keyboard/mouse injection +
  screenshots) used for all regression testing.
- tools/to8086.py + kernel/cpu8086.inc: mechanical 186+/386+ → 8086
  instruction rewriter and macro library for the planned 8088 compatibility
  pass (audit found 1153 non-8086 sites; see handoff doc for the plan).

### Known Remaining Work

See docs/AUDIT-HANDOFF-2026-06.md — notably: the 8088 conversion has NOT
been applied yet (the OS still requires a 386+ despite the README claim),
the cursor hide/lock race fix (35 sites) is pending, and several confirmed
medium findings remain open.

## [3.24.0] - 2026-06-10

### Heap Allocator Overhaul (Builds 401-402)

The kernel heap was unusable since the kernel outgrew 16KB: the heap segment
(0x1400) overlapped the kernel image (0x1000:0000, now 44KB), so the first
`malloc` corrupted live kernel code — and three further bugs meant it never
successfully returned memory anyway. This release relocates the heap and
makes malloc/free actually work.

### Fixed (Build 401) - Heap Relocation

- **Heap overlapped the kernel image** — heap segment moved from 0x1400
  (linear 0x14000, inside the 44KB kernel at 0x10000-0x1AFFF) to a dedicated
  segment 0x8000 (linear 0x80000, 60KB). The kernel can now grow to its full
  64KB segment without colliding with the heap. New `HEAP_SEGMENT`/`HEAP_SIZE`
  constants in kernel/kernel.asm replace hardcoded values.
  - Root cause: v3.6.0 documented moving the heap to 0x1600 when the kernel
    grew past 16KB, but the code change was never applied; the kernel has
    since grown to 44KB (88 sectors), deepening the overlap.
- **First-fit size check used signed comparison** (`jge`) — the initial
  0xF000-byte (60KB) free block read as negative, so `mem_alloc` always
  returned NULL (while still corrupting the kernel via heap lazy-init).
  Changed to unsigned (`jae`).
- **`heap_initialized` flag read/written through the heap segment** — the
  flag is kernel data, but DS points at the heap when it is accessed; now
  uses `cs:` segment overrides.

### Changed (Build 401)

- **User app segment pool reduced from 6 to 5 slots** (0x3000-0x7000);
  segment 0x8000 is now the kernel heap. Max concurrent user apps: 5 + shell.
  This was the only conflict-free placement: 0x2000 is the shell, 0x9000 is
  the scratch/clipboard segment, low memory holds the kernel stack, and any
  segment below 0x2000 collides with kernel growth.

### Documentation (Build 401)

- Memory maps updated in README.md, docs/MEMORY_LAYOUT.md,
  docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, docs/FEATURES.md, docs/API_REFERENCE.md,
  docs/APP_DEVELOPMENT.md
- Corrected stale kernel size (28KB → 44KB, 56 → 88 sectors, disk layout
  sectors) in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, docs/bootloader-architecture.md,
  docs/boot-debug-messages.md

### Verification

- New QEMU harness in test-artifacts/heap/: a test app (run as LAUNCHER.BIN)
  exercises INT 0x80 API 7/8, then run_heap_test.sh inspects guest memory via
  the QEMU monitor — heap block headers at linear 0x80000, and the old heap
  site 0x14000 compared byte-for-byte against build/kernel.bin to prove the
  kernel image is no longer modified.

## [3.19.0] - 2026-02-16

### Added (Builds 202-212) - FAT12 Write, GUI Toolkit, Settings Persistence

- **FAT12 Write Support** (Build 202)
  - `fs_create_stub` (API 45) — Create new file on FAT12 floppy
  - `fs_write_stub` (API 46) — Write data to open file
  - `fs_delete_stub` (API 47) — Delete file from FAT12 floppy
  - `fs_write_sector_stub` (API 44) — Write raw sector to disk
  - Full FAT12 cluster chain allocation for multi-cluster files

- **Boot Floppy Creator (MkBoot)** (Builds 202-204)
  - New app: creates bootable UnoDOS floppy from running system
  - Pre-reads apps to RAM, prompts for disk swap, writes boot+kernel+apps
  - Floppy-to-floppy copy workflow for users without build tools

- **GUI Toolkit Foundation** (Build 205)
  - Multi-font system: 4x6 small, 8x8 medium, 8x14 large fonts
  - `gfx_set_font` (API 48), `gfx_get_font_metrics` (API 49)
  - Word-wrap text drawing: `gfx_draw_string_wrap` (API 50)
  - Widget APIs: `widget_draw_button` (51), `widget_draw_radio` (52), `widget_hit_test` (53)
  - Clip rectangle system for constraining drawing operations

- **Settings App** (Builds 206-210)
  - Font selection (small/medium/large) with live preview
  - Color theme: text color, desktop background, window color (4 CGA colors)
  - Color swatch picker with radio buttons for font selection
  - Apply/OK/Defaults buttons
  - Settings persist to `SETTINGS.CFG` on boot floppy via FAT12 write APIs
  - Kernel loads settings at boot before launching apps

- **Color Theme System** (Builds 208-209)
  - `theme_set_colors` (API 54), `theme_get_colors` (API 55)
  - `draw_bg_color` for text background rendering
  - Desktop background color, window frame color, text color all configurable

### Fixed (Builds 202-212)

- **Disappearing Windows** (Build 211): Drawing APIs 0 (pixel), 1 (rect), 2 (filled rect) didn't hide mouse cursor during drawing. IRQ12 could XOR the cursor over window frame pixels between API calls, progressively corrupting borders. Fixed by adding cursor_hide/cursor_locked to all drawing APIs.
- **MkBoot Window Redraw** (Build 211): MkBoot defined `API_WIN_DRAW equ 30` but the correct value is 22. API 30 is `mouse_is_enabled`, so the window redraw call was silently doing nothing.
- **draw_bg_color Pollution** (Build 211): `draw_desktop_region` set `draw_bg_color` to desktop color but never restored it, leaking into subsequent window drawing operations.
- **fs_open_stub Mount Handle** (Build 210): Compared full 16-bit BX for mount handle routing, but callers set only BL. Dirty BH caused silent open failures. Fixed to compare BL only.
- **fs_readdir_stub Mount Handle** (Build 209): Same BX vs BL routing bug as fs_open_stub.
- **Button Text Overflow** (Build 210): `widget_draw_button` didn't clip label text to button bounds. Fixed by setting clip rectangle before drawing label.
- **Mouse Click Events** (Build 207): `event_get_stub` wasn't setting CF flag correctly for mouse events, causing click handlers to miss events.

### Changed (Builds 202-212)

- API table expanded from 44 to 56 function slots (APIs 44-55)
- CGA pixel plotting functions refactored: shared `cga_pixel_calc` helper saves ~100 bytes (Build 212)
- FAT12 stack cleanup comments updated from stale line numbers to descriptive labels (Build 212)
- File handle validation uses `FILE_MAX_HANDLES` constant instead of magic number 16 (Build 212)
- Coordinate translation in INT 0x80 handler now covers APIs 0-6 and 50-52 (widget APIs)

## [3.18.0] - 2026-02-16

### Added (Builds 194-201) - Splash Screen, Multitasking Fixes, Refresh Icon

- **Splash Screen with Logo** (Builds 196-201)
  - "U" logo drawn with white filled rectangles during boot
  - "UnoDOS 3" title and "Loading..." text displayed
  - Progress bar fills as apps are discovered from disk
  - Replaces blank/debug screen during launcher initialization
  - Fast CGA memory clear via REP STOSW (Build 200)

- **Floppy Refresh Icon** (Build 195)
  - Manual disk rescan icon appears as last desktop icon on floppy boot
  - 3.5" floppy disk shape (16x16 2bpp CGA bitmap)
  - Replaces automatic INT 13h AH=16h polling (caused constant floppy seeking)
  - Only shown when booted from floppy

- **Launch Error Feedback** (Build 195)
  - "Insert app disk" message for mount/file errors (codes 2, 3)
  - Error message auto-clears after ~2 seconds with desktop redraw

### Fixed (Builds 194-201)

- **File Browser HD Support** (Build 194): Browser now queries boot drive
  and saves mount handle, fixing blank listing on HD/CF/USB boot
- **Floppy Seeking Noise** (Build 195): Removed automatic floppy swap
  polling (INT 13h AH=16h) that caused audible seeking on IBM PS/2 L40
- **Music App Single Tone** (Build 197): App played one constant note
  instead of Fur Elise melody. Root cause: `app_yield_stub` didn't
  preserve general-purpose registers across context switches, so CX
  (note duration) was clobbered by the launcher. Fixed with pusha/popa.
- **App Launch Crash** (Build 198): Adding pusha/popa to yield broke
  new task startup — `popa` consumed return addresses instead of
  register values. Fixed by adding dummy pusha frame (8 zero words)
  to initial task stack built by `app_start_stub`.
- **Initial Context Switch Loop** (Build 201): `auto_load_launcher`
  did bare `ret` without `popa`, popping 0 from the dummy pusha frame
  instead of `int80_return_point`. This jumped to kernel entry (0x0000)
  in an infinite loop: boot → load launcher → ret to kernel → repeat.
  Fixed by adding `popa` before `ret` in both `auto_load_launcher` and
  `app_exit_common`.

### Changed

- Bootloader version updated from v0.2 to v3.18
- All boot diagnostic code removed (keypress wait, BIOS teletype,
  CGA white boxes, PRE/POST markers)
- Splash screen text uses transparent background (Build 199)
- Desktop/splash screen clear uses direct CGA REP STOSW (Build 200)

### Removed

- Kernel boot keypress wait
- Kernel BIOS teletype diagnostic output
- Kernel "PRE"/"POST" CGA diagnostic strings
- Launcher CGA diagnostic white boxes (marks 1-6)

---

## [3.17.0] - 2026-02-15

### Added (Builds 162-193) - Universal PS/2 Mouse via BIOS Services

- **BIOS PS/2 Mouse Driver** (Build 187+)
  - Uses BIOS INT 15h/C2xx services instead of direct KBC port I/O
  - INT 15h/C205 (init), C207 (set callback), C200 (enable)
  - Works with USB mice via BIOS legacy emulation (SMI-based)
  - FAR CALL callback handler (`mouse_bios_callback`) processes packets from BIOS
  - Falls back to direct KBC method if BIOS services unavailable

- **Robust KBC Mouse Init** (Build 185)
  - KBC output buffer flush (16-byte drain loop) before init
  - Keyboard interface disabled (0xAD) during mouse setup
  - Long timeout for ACK wait (~1 second via BIOS timer tick)
  - Mouse reset retried up to 3 times
  - Keyboard re-enabled (0xAE) on both success and failure

- **Boot Diagnostic** (Build 184+)
  - Mouse init result displayed at boot: B=BIOS, K=KBC, R/S/E=failure
  - Keypress wait after diagnostic for hardware verification

### Fixed (Builds 162-193)

- **USB Legacy Emulation Conflict** (Build 187): BIOS SMI handler was overriding
  direct KBC port writes, re-masking IRQ12 and disabling aux clock. Solved by
  switching to BIOS INT 15h/C2 services which work *with* the SMI handler.
- **BIOS Callback AH Corruption** (Build 188): `mov ah, bh` in X sign-extend
  overwrote the status byte stored in AH, breaking Y sign extension.
- **Callback Byte Order** (Build 192): Discovered via QEMU raw stack dump that
  BIOS pushes status,X,Y,0 before CALL FAR, making [BP+12]=status, [BP+10]=X,
  [BP+8]=Y, [BP+6]=padding. All previous convention assumptions were wrong.
- IRQ2 cascade unmask added for IRQ12 propagation (Build 186)
- Removed fragile auto-detection of callback byte conventions (Build 192)

### Changed

- Mouse driver architecture: BIOS services primary, direct KBC fallback
- Kernel alignment pad bumped (0x11A0 → 0x13A0) for new mouse init code

---

## [3.16.0] - 2026-02-14

### Added (Build 161) - Hard Drive Boot Support

- **Hard Drive Boot Verified** (Build 161)
  - Full MBR → VBR → Stage2_hd → Kernel boot chain tested
  - FAT16 filesystem on 64MB partition with all apps
  - Boots from hard drives, CF cards, and USB flash drives (via BIOS emulation)

- **Boot Drive Query API** (Build 161)
  - New API 43: get_boot_drive — returns boot drive number in AL
  - Enables apps to detect floppy (0x00) vs hard drive (0x80) boot

### Fixed (Build 161)

- Launcher now queries boot drive from kernel instead of hardcoding floppy
- Launcher uses correct mount handle for FAT12/FAT16 routing
- read_bin_header uses dynamic mount handle (was hardcoded FAT12)
- Floppy swap detection skipped when booted from hard drive
- fat16_read 32-bit arithmetic: sector calculation no longer truncates to 16 bits
- MUSIC.BIN added to HD image (was missing from create_hd_image.py)

### Changed

- API table expanded from 43 to 44 functions (get_boot_drive)
- Launcher detects boot media type automatically

- **Z-Order Window Management** (Builds 155-159)
  - Background windows blocked from drawing over foreground
  - Topmost window bounds cache for O(1) clipping
  - Active/inactive title bar visual distinction
  - Active: filled white title bar with black text
  - Inactive: black title bar with white text outline
  - Automatic title bar style update on focus change

### Fixed (Builds 151-159)

- Build 153: Floppy read retry logic for reliable loading on real hardware
- Build 154: App load error code diagnostic in launcher
- Build 155: Background windows losing content due to overzealous z-order clipping
- Build 157: Post-drag z-order — desktop icons and background frames showing through moved window
- Build 158: Per-draw-call z-order clipping (point-inside-topmost check)
- Build 159: Simplified to full background draw blocking (fixes multi-pixel bleed-through)

### Changed

---

## [3.13.0] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed (Build 135) - Text Width Measurement

- **gfx_text_width returned wrong values** - Was reporting 8px per character but draw_char advances 12px (8px glyph + 4px gap). Fixed to return 12px per character, matching actual rendering.
- **Clock content overflowed window** - "00:00:00" = 96px (8×12) but was drawn at X=22 in 108px content area. Repositioned to X=6 for proper centering.
- **Launcher help text caused white boxes** - "W/S/Arrows: Select" = 216px (18×12), far too wide for window. Removed help text from launcher.

### Added (Builds 127-134) - Mouse Cursor, Window Dragging, Drawing Context

- **XOR Mouse Cursor** - 8x10 arrow sprite drawn with plot_pixel_xor (self-erasing)
  - Cursor hide/show with `cursor_locked` flag for flicker-free rendering
  - Visible on all backgrounds (white on black, black on white)

- **Window Title Bar Dragging** - Click and drag windows by title bar
  - Three-layer architecture: IRQ12 detection → drag state machine → deferred processing
  - `mouse_hittest_titlebar` checks all visible windows for click hits
  - `mouse_drag_update` tracks offset and target position
  - `mouse_process_drag` called from event_get_stub (safe from reentrancy)

- **OS-Managed Content Preservation** - Window content saved during drags
  - Scratch buffer at segment 0x5000 stores CGA pixel data
  - Byte-aligned save/restore with `min(old_bpr, new_bpr)` for cross-boundary moves
  - Apps don't need to redraw when their window is dragged

- **Window Drawing Context** (APIs 31-32) - Apps use window-relative coordinates
  - `win_begin_draw` activates context for a window handle
  - `win_end_draw` deactivates context
  - APIs 0-6 automatically translate BX/CX from (0,0)=content-top-left to absolute screen

- **Text Width Measurement** (API 33) - `gfx_text_width` returns string width in pixels

- **gfx_draw_string_inverted** (API 6) - Fixed to use caller_ds for string access
  - Was reading from kernel segment (DS=0x1000) instead of app's segment
  - Caused white garbage boxes when launcher drew help text

### Changed (Builds 127-134)

- API table moved from 0x0F00 to 0x0F80 (more code space)
- API count increased from 30 to 34 (functions 30-33)
- Mouse enabled by default at boot (was disabled)
- Launcher binary: 1304 → 1069 bytes (removed debug code and help text)

- **IDE/ATA Direct Access Driver** - Fallback for BIOS issues
  - `ide_detect` - Detect IDE drive presence via IDENTIFY command
  - `ide_wait_ready` - Wait for drive ready (BSY clear, DRDY set)
  - `ide_read_sector` - Direct port I/O read (ports 0x1F0-0x1F7)
  - Supports LBA addressing mode

- **HD Boot Support** - Boot UnoDOS directly from hard drive
  - `boot/mbr.asm` - Master Boot Record with partition table parsing

- **'L' key handler** in keyboard demo
  - Press 'L' to trigger app loader test
  - Prompts to insert app disk
  - Loads and runs HELLO.BIN from disk

### Fixed (Build 008)
- **Keyboard ISR register corruption** - INT 09h handler was modifying DX register
  without saving/restoring it, causing display corruption on real hardware
  - Added push/pop dx to int_09_handler
- **Error code display position** - Error digit was drawn at X=100, overlapping with
  'I' in "FAIL". Moved to X=136 (after 11-character string)

### Fixed (Build 009)
- **App loader filename format** - fat12_open expects "HELLO.BIN" (with dot separator)
  but kernel was passing "HELLO   BIN" (raw FAT 8.3 format without dot)
  - Changed .app_filename to include dot separator
  - fat12_open parses the dot to split name/extension correctly
- **Dynamic build numbers** - Version and build strings are now generated from files
  - BUILD_NUMBER file contains current build number

  - Kernel at 0x1000:0000 (28KB)
  - Heap at 0x1400:0000 (apps loaded here via mem_alloc)

- App table entry (32 bytes):
  - Offset 0: State (0=free, 1=loaded, 2=running, 3=suspended)
  - Offset 2: Code segment
  - Offset 4: Code offset (entry point)
  - Offset 6: Code size
  - Offset 8-10: Stack segment/pointer (for future multitasking)
  - Offset 12-22: Filename (8.3 format)

### Future Enhancements Prepared
- App table includes state field for cooperative multitasking
- Stack segment/pointer fields for context switching
- Priority field for future scheduler

  - DS register pushed during search loop wasn't being popped in .found_file path
  - Caused system hang after finding file
  - Fixed by adding `add sp, 2` for DS cleanup

- **LBA to CHS conversion in fat12_read** (Critical)
  - Original code used bitmasks instead of proper division
  - DH (head) was never calculated
  - ES segment wasn't set for INT 13h read
  - BX (buffer pointer) was clobbered during division
  - Fixed with proper formula matching fat12_open's working code

- **Simplified attribute reading in fat12_open**
  - Removed unnecessary ES segment override
  - DS is already 0x1000 in the search loop

### Changed
- **fat12_read() rewritten for multi-cluster support**
  - Now loops through cluster chain until EOF or all bytes read
  - Reads each cluster sequentially into bpb_buffer
  - Copies data to user buffer and advances pointer (ES:DI) automatically
  - Updates file position correctly for multi-cluster reads

- **Debug code removed for release**
  - Removed D:, S:, A:, F: debug output from fat12_open
  - Removed comparison result (=/!) debug output
  - Removed unused debug strings (.dbg_dir, .dbg_srch, etc.)
  - Build string changed from "debug11" to "release"

### Technical Details
- FAT12 cluster chain algorithm:
  - Calculate FAT offset: `(cluster × 3) / 2`
  - Determine FAT sector: `reserved_sectors + (offset / 512)`
  - Cache FAT sector if not already loaded
  - Read 2 bytes from FAT at offset
  - If cluster is even: `value = word & 0x0FFF`
  - If cluster is odd: `value = word >> 4`
  - Check for end-of-chain: `value >= 0xFF8`

- LBA to CHS conversion for 1.44MB floppy (18 sectors/track, 2 heads):
  - Sector: `(LBA % 18) + 1`
  - Head: `(LBA / 18) % 2`
  - Cylinder: `LBA / 36`

### Hardware Verified
- ✅ Tested on HP Omnibook 600C (486DX4-75)
- ✅ Mount: OK
- ✅ Open TEST.TXT: OK
- ✅ Read: OK (multi-cluster)
- ✅ C1:A C2:B displayed correctly

### Testing
```bash
make test-fat12-multi      # Test with 1024-byte file
# Boot, press F, swap to test floppy
# Expected output: Mount: OK, Open: OK, Read: OK, C1:A C2:B
```

### Notes
- This release marks completion of FAT12 filesystem on real hardware
- Multi-cluster support enables loading applications larger than 512 bytes
- Critical foundation for Application Loader (v3.11.0)

2. **Standard Library (v3.14.0)**: graphics.lib, unodos.lib for C development
3. **Tier 2/3 Support**: Multi-floppy loading, HDD installation, FAT16/FAT32 drivers

### Known Limitations
- Read-only filesystem (no write support)
- Single cluster reads only (512 bytes max)
- No multi-cluster file spanning support
- No subdirectory support (root directory only)
- No long filename support (8.3 only)

## [3.7.0] - 2026-01-23

### Changed
- **Aggressive Kernel Optimization (Pre-Foundation 1.4/1.5)**
  - Removed test functions (test_int_80, test_graphics_api): ~200 bytes freed
  - Removed 21 character alias definitions (char_W, char_E, etc.)
  - Optimized all graphics API functions: replaced pusha/popa with targeted register saves
  - Optimized gfx_draw_rect_stub: eliminated ~80 bytes of redundant push/pop operations
  - Optimized plot_pixel_white: removed variable storage (pixel_save_x/y), stack-only implementation
  - Optimized setup_graphics: tighter BIOS call sequence
  - Optimized install_int_80: minimal register preservation
  - Welcome message now uses gfx_draw_string (string-based) instead of individual char draws

### Technical Details
- Kernel code: 2436 → 2416 bytes (20 bytes from optimization, ~200 from removal)
- Total space gained: ~220 bytes
- Available in 24KB kernel: **22,160 bytes** (sufficient for Foundation 1.4 + 1.5 + future features)
- Removed variables: pixel_save_x, pixel_save_y
- Removed test chars: test_W_char, test_eq_char
- Optimized functions maintain identical behavior, purely size/speed improvements

### Rationale
- Maximize space for Foundation 1.4 (Keyboard Driver ~800B) and 1.5 (Event System ~400B)
- Eliminate production overhead from debug/test code
- Optimize frequently-called graphics primitives
- Prepare for remaining Foundation Layer implementation

## [3.6.0] - 2026-01-23

### Changed
- **Kernel Expansion: 16KB → 24KB**
  - Kernel size increased from 16384 bytes (32 sectors) to 24576 bytes (48 sectors)
  - Provides headroom for Foundation 1.4 (Keyboard Driver, ~800 bytes) and Foundation 1.5 (Event System, ~400 bytes)
  - Heap start moved from 0x1400:0000 to 0x1600:0000
  - Available heap reduced from 540KB to 532KB (loses 8KB)

### Technical Details
- Modified boot/stage2.asm: KERNEL_SECTORS 32 → 48
- Modified kernel/kernel.asm: Final padding 16384 → 24576
- New memory layout:
  * 0x1000:0x0000 - Kernel (24KB, was 16KB)
  * 0x1600:0x0000 - Heap start (was 0x1400:0x0000)
  * ~532KB available for applications (was 540KB)
- Kernel headroom: ~7KB for future Foundation Layer components

### Rationale
- v3.5.0 reached exact 16KB capacity with Memory Allocator
- Foundation 1.4 and 1.5 require additional ~1200 bytes minimum
- 24KB expansion is conservative, leaves room for future enhancements
- 8KB heap reduction is negligible (still 532KB for apps)
- See docs/MEMORY_LAYOUT.md for detailed analysis

## [3.5.0] - 2026-01-23

### Added
- **Memory Allocator (Foundation 1.3)**
  - malloc(size): Allocate memory dynamically
  - free(ptr): Free allocated memory
  - First-fit allocation algorithm
  - Heap at 0x1400:0000, extends to ~640KB limit
  - Block header structure (size + flags)
  - Integrated with API table (offsets 6, 7)

### Technical Details
- Memory block header: 4 bytes [size:2][flags:2]
  * size: Total block size including header
  * flags: 0x0000 (free) or 0xFFFF (allocated)
- First-fit search algorithm for allocation
- Automatic heap initialization on first malloc
- Initial heap block: ~60KB (0xF000 bytes)
- 4-byte aligned allocations

### Implementation
- malloc(AX=size) → AX=pointer (offset from 0x1400:0000), 0 if failed
- free(AX=pointer) → frees memory block
- Heap starts at segment 0x1400 (linear 0x14000)
- Applications use ES=0x1400 + offset for memory access

### Size Impact
- Memory allocator: ~600 bytes
- Kernel size: Still 16KB (16384 bytes exact)
- Remaining capacity: ~0 bytes (at maximum)

## [3.4.0] - 2026-01-23

### Added
- **Graphics API Abstraction (Foundation 1.2)**

  - gfx_draw_char: Character rendering with coordinate parameters
  - gfx_draw_string: Null-terminated string rendering
  - gfx_draw_rect: Rectangle outline drawing
  - gfx_draw_filled_rect: Filled rectangle drawing
  - gfx_clear_area: Clear rectangular area (stub for now)

### Fixed
- Welcome message typo: "WELLCOME" → "WELCOME"

### Technical Details
- All graphics functions accessible via kernel API table
- Register-based calling convention:
  * gfx_draw_pixel(CX=X, BX=Y, AL=color)
  * gfx_draw_char(BX=X, CX=Y, AL=ASCII)
  * gfx_draw_string(BX=X, CX=Y, SI=string_ptr)
  * gfx_draw_rect(BX=X, CX=Y, DX=width, SI=height)
  * gfx_draw_filled_rect(BX=X, CX=Y, DX=width, SI=height)
- Kernel size: Still within 16KB limit

### Hardware Testing

  - API table header with magic number ('KA' = 0x4B41), version (1.0), function count
  - 10 stub functions for future implementation:
    * Graphics API (6 functions): draw_pixel, draw_rect, draw_filled_rect, draw_char, draw_string, clear_area
    * Memory management (2 functions): malloc, free
    * Event system (2 functions): get_event, wait_event
- Visual test for INT 0x80 - displays "OK" at bottom right if successful

### Technical Details
- API table positioned at exactly offset 0x0500 (verified in binary)
- Follows Windows 1.x/2.x, GEOS pattern for performance
- Far Call approach saves ~40 cycles per call vs pure INT approach (~9% CPU at 4.77MHz)
