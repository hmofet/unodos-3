## [Uno3D — portable 3D library + a 3D game across platforms] - 2026-06-15

UnoDOS gains hardware-accelerated 3D and a write-once 3D library.

- **Uno3D library** (`uno3d/`): a portable 3D graphics API with a swappable
  per-platform rasteriser backend (a `u3d_backend` vtable). The portable
  front-end does matrix math, transform, projection, back-face culling and
  near-plane clipping; backends just clear/rasterise/flush/present. Backends:
  `soft` (CPU rasteriser into the framebuffer — universal), `ps2-gs` (PS2
  Graphics Synthesizer via gsKit — real hardware 3D), `dc-pvr` (Dreamcast
  PowerVR2 via KallistiOS). Designed so a new platform is one new file.
- **A 3D game, "UnoDOS Runner"** (`uno3d/uno3d_game.c`): an obstacle-dodger
  written once against the Uno3D API + an abstract input struct; the same logic
  runs on the host (software), the PS2 (GS hardware, 60 fps in PCSX2) and the
  Dreamcast (PVR hardware, in Flycast).
- **Native UnoDOS 3D app** (`apps/runner3d.asm`, `RUN3D.BIN`): the bare-metal
  x86 OS can't run the C library, so its version of the game is a native NASM
  app that draws the same 3D corridor through the kernel's `INT 0x80` graphics
  API (VGA mode 13h, fixed-point perspective, filled-rect painter's order, 8088-
  compatible). Ships in the floppy image; the desktop launcher auto-discovers it.
- **Docs:** new [docs/UNO3D.md](docs/UNO3D.md) — overview, full API reference,
  and a guide to writing games with Uno3D; cross-linked from the root README and
  APP_DEVELOPMENT.

## [Apple IIGS port — FULL APP PARITY: OutLast + cooperative scheduler] - 2026-06-15 (Build 420)

The IIGS port reaches **complete app parity** - all 11 UnoDOS apps plus the
cooperative scheduler, every one implemented and verified headlessly.

- **OutLast (`iigs/outlast.i`, proc 10):** a pseudo-3D road racer - a
  perspective road raster (per-row half-width bands narrowing to the horizon)
  with an animated dashed centre line, a swaying curve, a steerable car, and a
  distance score, in 16-colour SHR (`iigs/shots/m3_outlast.png`).
  `tests/outlast.py` -> `OUTLAST PASS`.
- **Scheduler (verified):** UnoDOS/IIGS multitasks cooperatively - every app's
  per-frame tick scans the window table for its own window and advances it, so
  multiple app windows run concurrently each frame (the "cooperative-by-ticks"
  model the Apple II / SNES ports concluded on). `tests/scheduler.py` opens
  Dostris + Pac-Man together and confirms both advance -> `SCHEDULER PASS`.
- **The full app set:** SysInfo, Clock, Files, Notepad, Theme, Music, Tracker,
  Dostris, Pac-Man, OutLast, Paint. Nine headless regression suites + the CPU
  self-test all green. Remaining: real-hardware validation (GSplus/KEGS/MAME by
  hand, then FloppyEmu SmartPort) and audio-by-ear (DOC sound isn't harness-
  reproducible) - the cross-port hardware-blocked tail.

## [Apple IIGS port — Pac-Man (maze chase on Super Hi-Res)] - 2026-06-15 (Build 419)

`iigs/pacman.i` (proc 9): a 13x11 maze of 8x8 cells, tile-stepped pac (arrow
keys, queued turns) eating dots for score, two ghosts that greedily chase
(non-reversing legal move minimising Manhattan distance, at half speed),
collision = caught, all dots = win - classic blue maze / grey dots / black
corridors (`iigs/shots/m3_pacman.png`). `tests/pacman.py` -> `PACMAN PASS`
(launch / eat dots / ghost chase / collision). Remaining for full parity:
OutLast (pseudo-3D racer) + scheduler.

## [Apple IIGS port — Tracker (4-voice DOC pattern sequencer)] - 2026-06-15 (Build 418)

`iigs/tracker.i` (proc 8): a 16-step x 4-channel pattern grid edited with the
arrows + number keys, P toggles playback, and `tracker_tick` plays each step's
four channels on DOC oscillators 0-3 - real polyphony on the IIGS
(`iigs/shots/m3_tracker.png`). `tests/tracker.py` -> `TRACKER PASS` (edit /
cursor / 4-voice DOC playback verified via the harness DOC log). Remaining for
full parity: Pac-Man, OutLast, scheduler.

## [Apple IIGS port — Paint (mouse-driven Super Hi-Res colour canvas)] - 2026-06-15 (Build 417)

`iigs/paint.i` (proc 6): a 36x18 fat-pixel canvas, an 8-colour ink palette,
drag-to-paint (`paint_tick` paints the cell under the cursor while the button is
held over the canvas), number keys 1-8 pick the ink, C clears
(`iigs/shots/m3_paint.png`). `tests/paint.py` -> `PAINT PASS`. The held click
that launches Paint is suppressed until released so it doesn't draw a stray cell.
Remaining for full parity: Pac-Man, OutLast, Tracker, scheduler.

## [Apple IIGS port — Dostris (colour Tetris on Super Hi-Res)] - 2026-06-15 (Build 416)

First colour game on the IIGS port: `iigs/dostris.i` (proc 5) — a 10x18 well of
8x8 SHR cells, 7 tetrominoes x 4 rotations, per-frame gravity (`game_tick`),
keyboard controls (arrows + space hard-drop), line clear + scoring, all in the
16-colour SHR game palette (`iigs/shots/m3_dostris.png`). `tests/dostris.py` ->
`DOSTRIS PASS` (move/rotate/drop/gravity/line-clear). Bug banked: a board
row-index helper aliased a caller's live temps (`DT1/DT2`) — gave it private
scratch. Remaining for full parity: Pac-Man, OutLast, Paint, Tracker, scheduler.

## [snes: milestone 3 complete — SPC700 audio + Music/Theme/Tracker/Paint + scheduler] - 2026-06-15

M3 closes the SNES port (M0–M3 done). The centrepiece is the SPC700 audio
driver; on top of it land the four M3 apps and the cooperative scheduler.

- **SPC700 audio core** (`spc700.py`, `sound.inc`) — ca65 can't target the
  SPC700, so a tiny two-pass Python SPC700 assembler builds the driver (a
  mailbox poll loop + DSP register writes), a square-wave BRR sample, and a
  MIDI→DSP-pitch table, emitted into gen_data.inc. The 65816 side does the
  IPL handshake upload on $2140–$2143, jumps the driver, and talks to it over
  a token-acked mailbox; every wait is timeout-bounded. Verified by ack
  ("Audio: SPC700 OK"); tone-by-ear is the hardware pass.
- **Music** (proc 3) — Canon in D on DSP voice 0.
- **Theme** (proc 8) — 8 presets + a BGR555 RGB editor. CGRAM is write-only
  outside vblank, so apply_theme edits a WRAM palette shadow and the NMI DMAs
  it to CGRAM (FlushPalette).
- **Tracker** (proc 9) — a 32×4 pattern sequencer on DSP voices 0–3, with
  SONG.TRK save/load via the USV1 SRAM.
- **Paint** (proc 10) — a per-pixel **canvas of unique tiles** (no bitmap
  mode on the SNES): pixels are painted into a planar-tile shadow in bank
  $7F and dirty tiles are DMA'd to VRAM by the NMI at ≤24/frame.
- **Scheduler** (`sched.inc`) — cooperative *by ticks*. The 65816 stack must
  live in bank 0, whose low 8 KB is full here (~736 B free), so the Genesis
  per-task-stack model can't fit; sched_run runs every app's *_tick from the
  main loop instead — same behaviour, no context switch. A documented verdict.

Deviations (HANDOFF): square-wave-only audio, the Tracker's tone-not-noise
4th channel, Paint's pencil-only/fixed-palette toolset, the tick-model
scheduler. Recurring traps fixed: the ca65 width trap (`.a8` at branch-target
labels after a `rep`), long-indexing is X-only (the dirty ring), STZ has no
long mode (bank-$7F clears use LDA #0/STA).

## [Apple IIGS port — M3: 4096-colour Theme + Ensoniq DOC audio] - 2026-06-15 (Build 415)

The two most IIGS-distinctive hardware features land.

- **4096-colour Theme (`iigs/theme.i`):** the 8 shared UI presets live-rewrite
  SHR palette line 0 (`$E1:9E00`); because Super Hi-Res looks up the palette per
  pixel at scan-out, one palette poke recolours the entire desktop instantly
  with no pixel redraw (`iigs/shots/m3_theme.png`).
- **Ensoniq DOC audio (`iigs/snd.i`):** the marquee IIGS sound chip — 32
  oscillators, 64 KB dedicated sound RAM — driven through the sound GLU
  (`$C03C`–`$C03F`). `doc_init` halts the oscillators and loads a wavetable into
  DOC RAM; the Music app sequences a melody on oscillator 0 with a per-frame
  tick. Audio isn't reproducible in the ROM-free harness (no DOC synthesis), but
  every GLU register write is logged and asserted, so the oscillator-programming
  path is verified. `tests/m3.py` → `M3 PASS`.
- Remaining for full parity: the colour games (Dostris/Pac-Man/OutLast/Paint) +
  Tracker + scheduler — additive app files over the now-complete renderer,
  input, storage and audio foundations.

## [Apple IIGS port — M2: FAT12 storage over SmartPort + Files/Notepad] - 2026-06-15 (Build 414)

The IIGS port gains persistent storage: a real FAT12 volume on the 800 KB disk,
read and written through the SmartPort/ProDOS block firmware.

- **blk_io + FAT12 core (`iigs/fs.i`):** the kernel calls the slot firmware's
  ProDOS block driver (entry + unit stashed by `boot.s`) in 6502 emulation mode
  (`sec/xce` … `clc/xce`), then mounts a FAT12 volume — `fat_mount` (caches the
  3-sector FAT), `fat_list_root`, `fat_read_file` (single + multi-cluster), and
  a full write path (`fat_alloc_chain`/`fat_free_chain`/`fat_set_entry`/
  `fat_flush`/`fat_save_file`). Geometry is fixed and synced once with
  `mkfs.py`; little-endian fields read natively.
- **Files + Notepad (`iigs/apps.i`):** Files lists the root directory and opens
  the selected file into Notepad; Notepad is an append editor whose **Ctrl-S
  writes the buffer back to disk** — verified to persist across a full reboot of
  the image (`tests/m2.py` → `M2 PASS`, with `--writeback`).
- **Disk tooling:** `iigs/mkfs.py` writes the FAT12 volume at block 256;
  `mkdsk.py` reserves it. Bug banked: `blk_io` must not alias the FAT walkers'
  cluster temp (`F0`) — multi-cluster ops looped until it used private scratch.
  Next: M3 (colour apps + Ensoniq DOC audio + scheduler). Disk-loaded apps
  deferred.

## [dreamcast: emulator-verified at parity — runs in Flycast + AICA audio] - 2026-06-15 (Build 413)

The Dreamcast port now **runs**, not just compiles: it boots in the **Flycast**
emulator at native 640×480 / 60 fps and reaches feature parity with the family.

- **Booted + captured in Flycast** (REIOS HLE BIOS, no Sega BIOS file): the
  desktop + all 11 app icons, Pac-Man, Dostris, Tracker, Paint, Theme, Files,
  OutLast, and the Music+Files+Notepad stack — `dreamcast/shots/dc_*.png`, grabbed
  from the emulated PowerVR (not the host shim).
- **VMU storage verified in-emulator**: the Notepad save→clear→reload autotest
  writes to `/vmu/a1` and reads the bytes back; the restored text proves the KOS
  `/vmu` VFS round-trip (`dreamcast/shots/dc_vmu.png`).
- **AICA audio wired** (`dc_main.c` `uno_dc_snd_note/quiet` + the `mac_io.c` Sound
  Manager): a looping square-wave `snd_sfx` sample pitched per MIDI note, one AICA
  channel per Sound Manager voice; Music / Tracker (4 voices) / Dostris drive it.
  The build boots with audio live; the sound itself is an ear-check (hardware),
  the same ceiling the other ports document.
- **Bootable `.cdi`** via **mkdcdisc** (`build.sh cdi`); `build.sh iso` is the
  no-mkdcdisc fallback (objcopy → scramble → makeip → genisoimage).
- **Toolchain + emulator built from source** under WSL: `sh-elf-gcc 15.2.0` +
  libkos (`utils/kos-chain`), and Flycast under Xvfb + Mesa llvmpipe. Rig gotchas
  recorded in `dreamcast/README.md`: Flycast needs a real disc format (not a bare
  `.iso`), `rend.EmulateFramebuffer = yes` (UnoDOS draws straight to VRAM), and
  `rend.vsync = no` (Xvfb's 0 Hz refresh otherwise gates frame swaps → black).
- New: `dreamcast/dc_main.c` AICA synth + `dreamcast/tools/{emu_run.sh,
  capture_apps.sh}`. Remaining: real hardware (incl. the audio ear-check).

## [Apple IIGS port — M1: Super Hi-Res desktop + window manager] - 2026-06-15 (Build 412)

The IIGS port boots past the splash into a real, mouse-driven colour desktop
(`iigs/shots/m1_desktop.png`).

- **SHR desktop + window manager:** menu bar, icon grid, version line, and the
  full PORT-SPEC §2 WM — a 16-slot window table (6 live), z-order with
  raise-on-click, title-bar drag, and a close box — ported from the proven SNES
  expression onto an 8×8 cell grid (40×25 on 320×200), all in 16-colour Super
  Hi-Res via a 4bpp text/rect engine over the shared 8×8 font.
- **Real pointer + keyboard:** a polled ADB mouse drives a save-under software
  cursor (no hardware sprite on SHR); the `$C000`/`$C010` keyboard latch feeds
  the event queue. Icons launch by double-click or arrow-keys + Return; ESC
  closes the topmost window.
- **SysInfo + Clock:** machine identity and a live `HH:MM:SS` uptime clock.
- **Fast bank-0 state:** kernel-normal DBR=$00, so all WM state and tables live
  in fast bank-0 RAM; the bank-$E1 SHR framebuffer is reached via 24-bit
  pointers and long-indexed stores (DBR never moves) — avoiding a Mega-II-RAM
  speed regression.
- **Harness:** a `wdm #$02` frame marker (a NOP on real silicon) lets the
  ROM-free rig step frame-by-frame, inject keys, and feed a signed-delta ADB
  mouse FIFO (`$C024`/`$C027`); a `boot/wait/key/move/click/shot` script runner
  mirrors the apple2 rig. Regression `iigs/tests/m1.py` → `M1 PASS`. Next: M2
  (SmartPort + FAT12 + Files/Notepad).

## [8088 port — boot off a CompactFlash card on an XT-IDE adapter] - 2026-06-15

UnoDOS now boots and runs from a CF card on an XT-IDE controller on a real 8088.
The hard-disk path (mbr/vbr/stage2_hd + the kernel FAT16 driver) is 386-only by
design, so this ships a **FAT12 "superfloppy" CF** that reuses the 8086-clean
FAT12 stack; full FAT16-on-8088 is a tracked follow-up.

- **Geometry-aware disk I/O.** `boot/stage2.asm` and the new kernel
  `probe_boot_disk` query the boot device's CHS geometry via INT 13h AH=08h
  (`disk_spt`/`disk_heads`), and the FAT12 read/write helpers
  (`floppy_read_sector(s)`, `floppy_write_sector`, `fs_readdir_stub`) were
  parameterized to use `[boot_drive]` + that geometry instead of the hardcoded
  drive 0 / 18 SPT / 2 heads. All defaults equal the old floppy constants, so
  the floppy boot path is byte-identical (regression-verified).
- **Filesystem routing by detection, not drive class.** `probe_boot_disk` reads
  LBA 0 and, if the OEM field is `'UNODOS'`, sets `boot_fs16=0` (FAT12); a real
  FAT16 HD stays `boot_fs16=1`. `fs_mount_stub` + the `load_settings` paths now
  route by `boot_fs16`, so a FAT12 CF on drive 0x80 mounts as FAT12.
- **Tooling/rig:** `tools/xt/make_cf_vhd.py` builds the bootable CF VHD (the
  1.44MB image overlaid on the front of a CF-sized VHD), and the
  `unodos_xt_xtide` MartyPC machine adds an XtIde HDC.
- **Verified** on the cycle-accurate 8088 XT-IDE rig: XT-IDE Universal BIOS
  detects the CF, GLaBIOS boots C:, UnoDOS reaches the desktop, SysInfo reports
  "Boot: HD/CF", and Files lists the CF's FAT12 directory (`tools/xt/shots/cf_*.png`).
- Deviations: usable space capped at the 1.44MB FS image; not interchangeable
  with a DOS-formatted CF; host write-back via MartyPC's GUI menu. See
  `docs/PORT-8088.md`.

## [snes: milestone 2 complete — Dostris, OutLast, Pac-Man] - 2026-06-15

M2's three shared games join the storage core, closing M2. All in
`snes/games.inc`, cell-rendered on the shadow+DMA model, verified in Mesen2
via the F12 framebuffer rig.

- **Dostris** (proc 4) — the Genesis piece tables, scoring and physics; the
  game-mode pad remap (d-pad with hold-repeat, A = hard drop, X = new,
  Y = pause) and a Score/Lines/Level panel.
- **OutLast** (proc 5) — a linear-perspective scrolling racer: converging
  grass/road/stripe bands (half-width = `row − HORIZ`, divide-free), a
  steerable car, and a Spd/Time HUD. DEVIATION from Genesis: no per-row 1/z
  raster, road curve, or oncoming traffic — the 65816 has no fast software
  16/16 divide.
- **Pac-Man** (proc 6) — the full x86 ghost AI (Blinky direct, Pinky
  4-ahead, Clyde hybrid, scatter/chase schedule, frightened eat-chain)
  intact, recast to tile coordinates. DEVIATION: actors are CELL-GRID BG
  tiles (new shaped pac/ghost/dot/pellet/gate tiles in `mkdata.py`), not
  pixel-smooth OAM sprites — one tile per step, collisions by tile equality.
  The 28×25 maze + a 1-row HUD fill the 30×28 window. Seventh desktop icon.

Trap fixed: the Pac-Man state block first overlapped the 2 KB Notepad buffer
at `$0400-$0BFF` (`notepad_set_demo` seeded `$534F` into the hi-score);
repacked into free WRAM at `$0CC8-$0FE5`, above the Dostris board and below
the tilemap shadow.

## [ps2: EE audio — square-wave synth on the SPU2 via audsrv] - 2026-06-15

The PS2 Sound Manager is no longer a silent stub — Music's Canon in D and the
Tracker patterns now play through the SPU2. New file `ps2/ee_audio.c`; the PS2
port reaches feature parity with the mature targets (only a real-hardware run
remains).

- **audsrv-backed square-wave synth.** `SndDoImmediate` (mac_io.c, EE branch)
  routes `noteCmd`/`quietCmd` to an 8-voice phase-accumulator square-wave synth
  (MIDI→Hz table, ~3500 amplitude/voice) mixed to 16-bit / 22050 Hz / stereo and
  streamed to the SPU2 via **audsrv**. `audsrv.irx` is embedded with `bin2c`;
  **LIBSD** (its SPU2 driver) is loaded from `rom0`.
- **Frame-paced, non-blocking.** `uno_audio_pump` runs once per frame from
  `uno_ee_present` and only writes `audsrv_available()` bytes, so it never stalls
  the loop and stays single-threaded on the SIF bus with the USB poll.
- **Boot safety + a unified I/O thread.** `audsrv_init` spins on SIF RPC until the
  IOP audio server answers — which never happens under PCSX2's fastboot HLE, so
  on the main thread it black-screened the boot (exactly like the USB
  `PS2KbdInit`/`PS2MouseInit` binds). Both bring-ups now run on one **low-priority
  I/O thread** (`io_init_thread`) holding a shared **SIF lock**; the per-frame
  audio pump and USB poll probe that lock non-blocking and skip a frame rather
  than race it. The desktop boots and runs at 60 fps regardless; each device
  comes alive the instant its driver registers. The USB init was refactored from
  its own thread (added earlier today) into this shared one.
- **Verified:** full desktop boots in PCSX2 at FPS 60 with audsrv + all three USB
  modules loaded and the I/O thread running (`ps2/shots/m3_audio_boot.png`). The
  audio output itself is hardware-only to verify — PCSX2 can't drive
  SPU2-via-audsrv under fastboot, the same ear-check ceiling as the other ports.

## [Apple IIGS port — M0: 65C816 native boot + Super Hi-Res splash] - 2026-06-15 (Build 411)

First milestone of the **Apple IIGS** port (`iigs/`): a native 65C816 / Super
Hi-Res reimagining of UnoDOS that uses the IIGS hardware the plain Apple II
lacks. `./build.sh` produces `iigs/build/unodos_iigs.po`, an 800 KB ProDOS-order
disk that boots to a 16-colour SHR splash (`iigs/shots/m0.png`).

- **Boot chain (verified):** ProDOS block firmware loads block 0 to `$0800` and
  enters at `$0801` in 6502 emulation mode; the boot stage finds the slot's
  ProDOS block driver (`$Cn00+[$CnFF]`), reads the kernel from blocks 1..K to
  `$00:2000`, switches to native 16-bit mode (`clc/xce`, `rep #$30`), and jumps
  in. No GCR — the SmartPort firmware is the disk driver (the ".Sony equivalent").
- **Super Hi-Res, in colour:** `NEWVIDEO ($C029)=$C1` enables SHR; the kernel
  paints a desktop, menu bar, and a framed window with a 4bpp text engine that
  expands the shared UnoDOS 8×8 font (320×200, 160 B/row, high-nibble = left px,
  `$0RGB` palette at `$E1:9E00`).
- **ROM-free harness (the M0 wildcard, resolved):** no usable `py65816` exists
  and no IIGS ROM/MAME is on hand, so `iigs/cpu65816.py` is a new
  functionally-correct 65C816 interpreter (native+emulation, M/X widths, full
  opcode/addressing set, MVN/MVP, WDM trap; self-tests). `iigs/harness.py` plays
  the firmware around it — block autoload, the ProDOS driver (read + write,
  `--writeback`), the `$C0xx` soft-switch page — and renders SHR → PNG. CI-able
  with zero ROM dependency. GSplus/KEGS/MAME stay the by-hand rigs; real hardware
  is FloppyEmu in SmartPort mode.
- **Toolchain:** cc65 `ca65 --cpu 65816` + `ld65` (shared with the SNES port).
  Regression `iigs/tests/m0.py` → `M0 PASS`. Next: M1 (desktop + WM + ADB
  mouse/keyboard + SysInfo/Clock).

## [8088 port — feature parity on a cycle-accurate IBM PC/XT] - 2026-06-15 (Build 410)

The x86 reference build now runs at **full feature parity on a genuine Intel
8088**, verified in MartyPC (cycle-accurate, open GLaBIOS). Closing out M0–M3.

- **App sweep (M1):** SysInfo, Settings, Files, Paint, Clock, Notepad, Music,
  Tracker and Pac-Man all launch and render on the emulated XT through the
  keyboard-driven launcher (`tools/xt/shots/m2_*.png`).
- **Storage (M2):** FAT12 **read** (kernel/app loads, Files directory listing)
  and **write** (Notepad save → "XTTEST", title confirms the write) both verified
  on the 8088.
- **Sound:** the PC-speaker apps (Music "Für Elise", Tracker pattern editor) run
  — audio itself isn't screenshot-verifiable, the standard cross-port caveat.
- **Performance (M3):** the `draw_char` CGA row-blit fast path
  (`draw_char_cga_fast` — one MUL/row, one RMW/VRAM-byte) was already in place and
  is active in CGA mode; all XT text renders through it. The earlier TODO entry
  was stale.
- **Documented deviations (real envelope, not fake parity):** VGA apps (mode 13h/
  12h: Dostris/OutLast/Pac-Man VGA) are out-of-envelope on a CGA 5150/5160
  (`m2_vga_out_of_envelope.png`); minimum RAM is 256K (desktop) / 640K (full);
  full-screen game pixel-fill is slow at 4.77 MHz (inherent, like the Apple II at
  1 MHz). **Remaining:** cross-boot floppy persistence (MartyPC writes back only
  via its GUI menu) + a physical IBM PC/XT pass — the same hardware-blocked
  final step as every other port. See `docs/PORT-8088.md`.

## [dreamcast: new port — M1 desktop + VMU storage, ELF compiles] - 2026-06-15 (Build 412)

A new port: **UnoDOS on the Sega Dreamcast** (Hitachi SH-4 / PowerVR2, via
KallistiOS). It reuses the PS2 port's portable-C-core strategy almost verbatim —
the same [mac/unodos.c](mac/unodos.c) core over the same Mac-compat shim — and
swaps only the present and input layers. New directory `dreamcast/`.

- **Software framebuffer at native 640×480.** All drawing is the shared
  `fb.c`/`fb.h` primitives (identical to PS2 bar the resolution); the core
  derives geometry from `gScreen`, so the desktop fills the Dreamcast's native
  640×480 with no letterboxing (vs the PS2's 640×448). Each vblank
  `dreamcast/dc_main.c` converts the ARGB8888 buffer to **RGB565** and copies it
  into the DC framebuffer (`vram_s`), then overlays the arrow cursor — the
  PowerVR2 is left idle ("FB as the blitter," the PS2 GS design).
- **Mac-compat shim shared.** `dreamcast/mac_compat.c`/`.h` are identical to the
  PS2 port; `dreamcast/unodos.c` is the core + `#ifdef UNO_DC` hooks
  (`uno_dc_init`/`poll`/`present`) mirroring the EE hooks.
- **Maple input** (`dc_main.c`): controller d-pad → arrow keys, A/Start →
  Return/Esc, the analog stick + a Dreamcast mouse → the pointer (trigger/left
  button clicks), a Dreamcast keyboard → typed text — all posted into the shim's
  event queue so the core's normal `GetNextEvent` loop consumes them.
- **M2 VMU storage** (`mac_io.c` DC branch): Files/Notepad/Tracker/Paint persist
  to the VMU (`/vmu/a1`) via the KOS VFS, using a flush-on-close RAM buffer per
  handle (whole-file save/load — matches UnoDOS's app model and the VMU's block
  flash). The HOST stdio backend stays byte-identical to PS2's.
- **Verified on the host shim** at 640×480: splash, desktop, window manager and
  all 11 apps render to PNGs (`dreamcast/shots/m1_*.png`) via WSL gcc — the exact
  code the DC ELF compiles.
- **The DC ELF compiles + links clean against KallistiOS.** The toolchain was
  built from source under WSL (`utils/kos-chain` → `Makefile.dreamcast.cfg` →
  `sh-elf-gcc 15.2.0` + binutils + newlib + `libkallisti.a`); `build.sh dc` links
  `build/unodos-dc.elf` (a real SH-4 ELF, entry `0x8c010000`) and `build.sh iso`
  packages `build/unodos-dc.iso` (a bootable selfboot image: scrambled
  `1ST_READ.BIN` + a homebrew `IP.BIN`, wrapped by `genisoimage`). Only benign
  warnings. **Not yet observed booting** — no DC emulator (Flycast/lxdream/
  redream) on the dev machine. M3 audio (AICA) is stubbed.
- Toolchain gotcha recorded: the KOS toolchain builder moved from `utils/dc-chain`
  (removed) to `utils/kos-chain`; the stock `environ.sh.sample` hard-codes
  `KOS_BASE=/opt/toolchains/dc/kos`, so a checkout elsewhere needs `KOS_BASE` /
  `KOS_ARCH=dreamcast` set or libkos can't find `environ_base.sh`.
- New files: `dreamcast/{unodos.c, fb.c, fb.h, mac_compat.c, mac_compat.h,
  mac_io.c, dc_main.c, uno_splash.c, host_main.c, host_desktop.c, Makefile,
  build.sh, mkfont_c.py, README.md, HANDOFF.md}`.

## [ps2: USB keyboard + mouse] - 2026-06-15

The PS2 desktop now takes input from a real USB keyboard and mouse, alongside
the DualShock 2 — both feed the same Mac-compat event queue. New file
`ps2/ee_usb.c`.

- **Self-contained drivers.** The three IOP modules (`usbd`, `ps2kbd`,
  `ps2mouse`) are embedded into the ELF via `bin2c` (Makefile rules →
  `build/*_irx.c`) and loaded with `SifExecModuleBuffer`, so a FreeMcBoot launch
  needs no external module files. Links `-lkbd -lmouse`.
- **Keyboard** runs in RAW (USB-HID-usage) mode; `hid_translate` owns a full US
  keymap — letters, digits, shifted symbols, arrows, Return/Esc/Backspace/Tab/
  Space — and maps Ctrl/Win to the Mac Command modifier. Events post into the
  shim queue, so the core's normal `GetNextEvent` loop consumes them (real
  typing into Notepad).
- **Mouse** runs in ABS mode clamped to the framebuffer, fed through
  `uno_set_mouse` + `mouseDown`/`mouseUp` edges, so clicks and drags work via
  the core's existing `GetMouse`/`StillDown` path. A small arrow **cursor** is
  drawn as a GS overlay in `uno_ee_present` (two `gsKit_prim_triangle`s on top
  of the blitted framebuffer), leaving unodos.c's software-FB XOR/incremental
  drawing untouched.
- **Boot safety.** `PS2KbdInit`/`PS2MouseInit` spin inside libkbd/libmouse until
  each IOP driver's RPC server registers — immediate on real hardware, but
  PCSX2 has no USB HLE so they never return, which black-screened the boot
  (they ran before the splash). Fixed by running the device init on a dedicated
  EE thread one priority notch below the main loop: the desktop boots and stays
  responsive regardless, and USB engages the instant the drivers register.
  Steady-state polling stays on the main thread, so SIF traffic is
  single-threaded.
- **Verified:** the full desktop boots in PCSX2 with all three modules loaded +
  the init thread running (`ps2/shots/m3_usb_boot.png`). The keyboard/mouse
  *function* is hardware-only — PCSX2 can't inject USB HID input.

## [8088 port M1/M2 — Microsoft serial mouse on COM1 + RAM floor] - 2026-06-14 (Build 409)

Building on M0, the XT now has a working pointer and an honest RAM spec.

- **Microsoft serial mouse on COM1 (the XT pointing device).** A real IBM PC/XT
  has no PS/2 port, so UnoDOS's AT-class mouse paths (INT 15h/C2, KBC/IRQ12)
  never engaged — the cursor was static. New kernel code:
  - `install_serial_mouse` — programs the COM1 UART (1200 baud, 7N1), power-
    cycles the mouse via DTR/RTS, probes for the `'M'` identifier, then arms
    IRQ4 (INT 0x0C) and unmasks it on the PIC. On a pre-AT machine
    `install_mouse` now falls through from `.skip_kbc` to this probe instead of
    giving up (`mouse_diag='C'`).
  - `int_0C_handler` — the IRQ4 ISR: decodes the 3-byte Microsoft packet
    (sync-bit framing, signed 8-bit X/Y deltas, L/R buttons) into the shared
    `mouse_x/y` + `mouse_buttons`, reusing the existing deferred-cursor
    (`cursor_dirty`) and button-change event model from the PS/2 handlers.
  - Verified end-to-end on the cycle-accurate XT (MartyPC, host mouse captured,
    relative motion injected): the cursor tracks both axes with correct
    direction and a **double-click launches Settings** (`tools/xt/shots/
    m2_mouse_*.png`).
- **RAM floor corrected.** The 128K machine (`unodos_xt_128k`) boots the kernel
  but cannot load the launcher (it lives at segment `0x2000` = linear 128–192K),
  so the desktop never appears. The README/FEATURES "128 KB minimum" claim was
  false; corrected to **256 KB (desktop + one app) / 640 KB (full 5-app
  multitasking)**. See `docs/PORT-8088.md`.
- The kernel mid-file API-table pad was bumped 0x3800→0x3C00 for the new code.

## [8088 port M0 — UnoDOS boots on a cycle-accurate IBM PC/XT (8088)] - 2026-06-14

The x86 reference build already *is* the 8088 target, but for its whole life it
was only ever **run** on QEMU — a 486-class CPU that silently hides every real
8088 / IBM PC-XT behaviour. The 2026-06 audit's `cpu 8086` pass was only ever
assembler-verified. M0 stands up the missing "real emulator" tier and proves
the build on genuine 8088 silicon.

- **Rig** (`tools/xt/`): MartyPC 0.4.1 (cycle-accurate 8088, validated against
  real hardware) booting the open **GLaBIOS** — ROM-free, the same house rule
  as the macplus/Genesis/SNES ports. Machine `unodos_xt` = IBM 5160 (XT), 8088
  @ 4.77 MHz, 640K, CGA, 1.44M floppies, MS serial mouse on COM1. Capture via
  MartyPC's own framebuffer screenshot (`shot_xt.ps1`) — clean under RDP, no
  GPU-window-grab-is-black trap.
- **Result:** the primary `build/unodos-144.img` boots **end-to-end on the
  emulated XT** — boot sector → "Reset disk / Load stage2 / Loading kernel…" →
  the 104-sector kernel → the CGA "UnoDOS 3" splash → the 4-colour desktop →
  Enter launches **SysInfo** ("Boot: Floppy", "Tasks: 2 running"). The INT 0x80
  dispatcher, launcher, window manager and cooperative scheduler — all flagged
  186+/386+ by the audit — run correctly on real 8088 silicon, and the
  **keyboard works through the XT 8255 PPI path**. Shots in `tools/xt/shots/`.
- **Findings** (feed M1/M2): the README "128 KB minimum" is wrong — the launcher
  at `0x2000` needs RAM through ~192K and the full feature set (heap `0x8000`,
  clipboard/dialogs `0x9000`) needs 640K; the desktop + one app fit in 256K.
  The serial mouse is undriven (cursor static — UnoDOS's mouse paths are AT-only
  INT 15h/C2 + KBC). Boot to desktop takes ~30 s at real 4.77 MHz (the M3
  `draw_char` fast-path target). See `docs/PORT-8088.md`.
- No OS source changed in M0 (rig + validation + docs only), so the build number
  is unchanged.

## [snes: milestone 2 (storage core) — SRAM USV1 mini-FS + Notepad + Files] - 2026-06-15

M2's storage core: the battery SRAM filesystem and its two apps.

- **sram.inc** - the USV1 mini-FS on 8 KB of LoROM cartridge SRAM
  (byte-addressable at `$70:0000` - none of the Genesis odd-lane `*2` dance;
  little-endian words via 16-bit long-indexed loads). init/format,
  find/save/read/delete/count/name/size, heap compaction on delete. Header
  now declares it (cart type `$02`, SRAM size byte `$FFD8` = 3 = 8 KB).
- **apps.inc** - Notepad (proc 2): an append-style editor (soft keyboard /
  pad keys append to a 2 KB buffer, Backspace deletes, Enter = newline, F1
  saves under the current name to SRAM), shown as wrapped lines + a status
  bar. Files (proc 7): lists the SRAM directory with sizes, opens a file
  into Notepad (Enter), deletes (X/Backspace), arrows move the selection.
- Wired into the M1 WM: 4 desktop icons (SysInfo/Clock/Notepad/Files) via an
  icon->proc table, `app_draw_content` + `app_key` dispatch, and key routing
  from `handle_events` to the topmost app.
- **Verified in Mesen2** (build/m2.png): the AUTOTEST scene seeds Notepad
  (44-byte demo), saves DEMO.TXT to SRAM, and the Files window lists it at
  the right size - the full save -> directory -> listing round-trip. The
  interactive build boots clean.

Trap fixed: a ca65 width-tracking leak - `@format:` was reached at runtime in
8-bit A (via `bne` from the magic check), but the preceding match path's
`.a16` directive made ca65 assemble `lda #'U'` as a 2-byte immediate, so the
trailing `$00` ran as BRK and sprayed WRAM. A label reached in a different A
width than the assembler assumes needs an explicit `.a8`/`.a16` at the label.

Deviation: the Notepad is append-style (no full caret/line nav yet) - the
storage round-trip is what M2 proves. The M2 games (Dostris / Pac-Man /
OutLast) are the remaining M2 work.

## [snes: milestone 1 — tile desktop, window manager, apps, soft keyboard] - 2026-06-14

The SNES port grows a real desktop. The Genesis M1 surface
(genesis/kernel.asm + softkbd.i) is re-expressed in 65816 on the SNES
shadow+DMA architecture: a cell renderer over the WRAM tilemap shadow, a
window manager, a hardware-sprite cursor, pad-as-pointer + a soft keyboard,
and the SysInfo + Clock apps.

- **kernel.asm** (~1.5k lines): cell primitives (`fill_cells` / `draw_str`
  / `draw_char`) writing the tilemap shadow with four UI palette schemes
  (NORM/INV/ACC/KEY as Mode-1 palette lines 0-3); the window manager
  (z-order list, raise/close, title-bar drag with cell snapping, close box,
  window chrome); `launch_app` + an app-definition table; the event queue;
  pad-as-pointer input (d-pad accel cursor, A=click/drag, B=soft keyboard,
  Y=Enter, X=Backspace, Start=Esc, Select=Space, L/R=turbo) decoded from the
  auto-joypad word; the cursor as two OAM sprites flushed each vblank.
- **softkbd.inc**: the soft keyboard re-laid-out for 32 cells (Genesis is
  40) - layout table, hit-test, sticky shift, hover highlight, posts EV_KEY
  with the Amiga/Genesis raw codes.
- **SysInfo** (CPU/RAM/region/input) + **Clock** (a real 60 Hz NMI tick →
  HH:MM:SS), refreshed once a second.
- **NMI** runs on its own direct page ($0100) so its input/flush scratch
  never collides with the main loop's ($0000).
- **Verified in Mesen2** (build/m1.png): desktop + menu bar + two overlapping
  windows (correct z-order, chrome, white/cyan palettes) + a live advancing
  clock; VRAM proven byte-correct via CPU read-back.

Three traps fixed along the way (all in kernel.asm / HANDOFF.md): calling
the 16-bit cell routines with an 8-bit accumulator (garbage tiles); outer
loop counters clobbered by the draw routines they call (use the dedicated
LC0/LC1 slots); `FlushOAM` invoked with the wrong A width in the NMI.

Capture rig solved: the GPU surface is black through PrintWindow on this
headless host, and forcing Mesen's software renderer (to grab the window)
adds a display-blit artifact that drops BG palette bits below ~scanline 160.
The rig now triggers Mesen's own **F12 = TakeScreenshot** to dump the
accurate PPU framebuffer to disk (focus forced via AttachThreadInput) - the
reference render. `build/m1.png` shows the full desktop including the cyan
soft keyboard, exactly correct.

## [snes: milestone 0 — LoROM skeleton boots to the splash] - 2026-06-14

The SNES port opens: a 65816 LoROM cartridge boots in Mesen2 to the
"UnoDOS 3" tile splash and reacts to the joypad. This is the Genesis port's
twin, re-expressed in 65816 (HANDOFF.md), and it stands up the shared cc65
toolchain (ca65/ld65) and the foundation every later milestone hangs off.

- **`kernel.asm`** — native-mode bring-up (`clc/xce`, `rep #$38`), forced-
  blank PPU init, DMA upload of the tile blob + palette, Mode 1 / BG1, and
  the **shadow + DMA** render architecture (HANDOFF §2): the main loop
  writes a WRAM tilemap shadow at `$7E:1000`, the **vblank NMI** DMAs it to
  VRAM, acks, waits out the auto-joypad read, and latches `JOY1` — no
  app/WM logic in the ISR (PORT-SPEC §6 rule 2). The live controller word
  renders as `PAD:xxxx`.
- **`mkdata.py`** — the shared `kernel/font8x8.asm` → SNES **4bpp planar**
  tiles (32 B/tile) + a **BGR555** palette (entries 0–4 = the UnoDOS UI
  colours). 256×224 ⇒ **32×28 cells**, the documented narrower-by-8 metric
  vs. Genesis's 40×28.
- **`build.sh` / `lorom.cfg`** — cc65 build to a checksum-patched 32 KB
  LoROM `.sfc`, with an `AUTOTEST` variant that self-injects a synthetic
  joypad value in the NMI.
- **Rig** (`setup_mesen.ps1` / `run_mesen.ps1`) — Mesen2 forced to its
  software renderer (PrintWindow can't grab the GPU surface on this
  headless desktop) + window capture; input verified by the AUTOTEST build
  (the Genesis fallback), since Mesen's CLI doesn't autoload Lua.
- **Verified in Mesen2:** `build/desktop.png` (interactive, `PAD:0000`) and
  `build/autotest.png` (`PAD:C0A0`, `* AUTOTEST *`) — the read → shadow →
  DMA → display pipeline end to end. Two traps recorded in HANDOFF.md for
  M1: ca65's parameterised-`.define` half-stride evaluation, and the
  write-twice BG scroll registers.

## [ps2: milestone 2 — memory-card storage on the EE] - 2026-06-14

The EE File Manager now persists to the **PS2 memory card** via libmc, so
Files/Notepad save and load on real hardware and across boots.

- `ee_platform.c` loads `rom0:MCMAN/MCSERV`, runs `mcInit`, and brings up
  `/UnoDOS` (formatting the card only when `mcMkDir` reports `sceMcResNoFormat`,
  so an already-written card is never wiped).
- `mac_io.c` (EE branch) uses the libmc file API — `mcOpen` with
  `sceMcFileCreateFile`, `mcRead`/`mcWrite`/`mcClose`/`mcDelete`, `mcGetDir` for
  the catalog. (The PS2 MC isn't a POSIX FS — `open(O_CREAT)` makes a non-
  round-tripping directory entry; `mcOpen` makes a real save-file.)
- **Verified in PCSX2** (`shots/m2_pcsx2_*.png`): a 55-byte Notepad doc writes
  to the card, reloads byte-for-byte after the buffer is wiped, and — in a
  separate no-save run after a force-kill — loads back from the card, proving
  persistence across power cycles. The host build keeps the `uno_disk/`
  directory backend; both share the same File Manager code path.

## [ps2: milestone 1 — the desktop arrives (C core + Mac-compat shim)] - 2026-06-14

The portable C core (`mac/unodos.c`, 4139 lines — 11 apps + window manager +
event model + scheduler + FAT12) now runs on the PS2 by **swapping the platform
layer**, not rewriting (HANDOFF §1 strategy).

- **Mac-compat shim** (`mac_compat.h`/`.c`): the ~40 Mac Toolbox calls the core
  uses, re-implemented over the software framebuffer `fb.*` — one implicit
  full-screen GrafPort, QuickDraw rect/oval/line/text (Bresenham `LineTo`, 8×8
  `DrawText` at the pen baseline, `PaintOval`), pen + fore/back colour +
  transfer-mode state, a platform-fed event queue, a deterministic `TickCount`
  call-clock, and `NewPtr`/`DisposePtr`.
- **File Manager + Sound** (`mac_io.c`): `FSOpen/Read/Write/Create/Delete` +
  `PBGetCatInfo` over a real directory tree (the M2 storage backend), and a
  square-wave `Snd*` channel model (silent on host; audsrv on EE is the
  remaining M3 piece).
- **`ps2/unodos.c`**: the core, copied from `mac/unodos.c`. Divergences: the
  dozen Toolbox headers collapse to one `#include "mac_compat.h"`; Pascal
  literals (`"\pNAME"`) become octal-length C strings (gcc has no `\p`); the
  68K coroutine scheduler (`ctx_switch` asm) is guarded under `__m68k__` with a
  portable **kernel-driven (poll-and-dispatch) scheduler** for PS2/host — the
  Apple II model, identical app semantics.
- **Two front ends, both verified.** `host_desktop.c` builds the whole desktop
  with WSL gcc → PPM (the fast inner loop); `./build.sh desktop [FEATURE]`
  renders `shots/m1_*.png` — desktop + all 11 apps + the FAT12 write/read
  round-trip into Notepad all confirmed. `ee_platform.c` is the real EE target:
  GS-presents `fb` each vsync and maps the DualShock 2 to UnoDOS key events;
  `./build.sh ee [FEATURE]` links a real R5900 ELF and the desktop + Pac-Man
  render on the emulated GS in PCSX2 (`shots/m1_pcsx2_pacman.png`).

So **M1** (desktop/WM/apps) is verified on the host *and* the emulated PS2;
**M2** (File Manager + FAT12) and **M3 Theme** (32-bit colour) come along
through the shim. (Memory-card storage landed in M2 below; remaining: EE audio
via audsrv, and a USB keyboard.)

## [ps2: milestone 0 — software-FB foundation + EE ELF builds] - 2026-06-14

First milestone of the **Sony PS2 port** (`ps2/`), strategy = port the
portable C core (`mac/unodos.c`) by swapping the platform layer.

- Software framebuffer (`fb.c`/`fb.h`): 640×448×32 in EE RAM + drawing
  primitives (fill/frame/invert-XOR/8×8 text/scaled text) over the 4-colour
  PORT-SPEC gamut — the layer the whole port draws through; the GS is reduced
  to a per-vsync textured-quad blit.
- Shared font → C array (`mkfont_c.py`); hello-GS splash (`uno_splash.c`).
- **Host shim** (`host_main.c` + `tools/ppm2png.py`): builds the FB code with
  a host compiler (WSL gcc) and renders `shots/m0_splash.png` — the splash is
  verified on the PC, and the EE target shares the FB/splash code verbatim.
- EE target (`main.c`: gsKit GS init + FB→GS blit + DualShock 2 via SIO2MAN/
  PADMAN). **Builds** to `build/unodos-ps2.elf` (real MIPS R5900 ELF) with the
  prebuilt ps2dev v2.0.0 toolchain under WSL, and **runs on the emulated GS**:
  PCSX2 v2.6.3 + a 4 MB PS2 BIOS boots the ELF and renders the splash through
  the real GS pipeline (`shots/m0_pcsx2.png`, captured by `tools/run_pcsx2.ps1`).
  Rig gotcha: PCSX2 v2.x needs `[UI] SettingsVersion = 1` in `PCSX2.ini` or it
  refuses the config and blocks the boot. M1 (the C-core desktop) is unblocked
  and host-shim-iterable.

## [apple2: milestone 3 — full app roster + feasibility verdicts] - 2026-06-14

The **Apple II port** (`apple2/`) reaches M3: a 10-icon desktop on the 1 MHz
6502, all harness-verified.

- New apps: **Theme** (6 dither presets over a mutable `pat_tab`), **Dostris**
  (10×20 puzzle), **Pac-Man** (the 1 MHz adaptation — 13×13 maze, two
  Manhattan-steer ghosts, tile-stepped 7px actors), **Music** (Canon in D on
  the `$C030` speaker, blocking square-wave staff player), **Tracker** (shared
  32×4 pattern format, single-voice playback, SONG.UNO save/load), **Paint**
  (32×34 fat-pixel cells, four dither inks, PAINT.UNO save/load).
- **OutLast** feasibility: ships as a ~4 fps prototype (28-band half-res road
  raster — measured, just under the 5 fps bar but steering-responsive).
- **Scheduler** verdict: stack-partitioning proven (40 cooperative switches,
  canaries intact), but the shipping kernel keeps poll-and-dispatch.
- `tests/m3.script` + 7 per-app scripts + scheduler proto, all green.
  Real-hw (AppleWin/FloppyEmu) pass still pending.

## [macplus: real Mac SE audio fix] - 2026-06-14

Sound was silent on the real SE: `snd.i` wrote the PWM buffer but never
enabled the hardware there and set "volume" on the wrong VIA port (PB0-2 are
the RTC lines; volume is Port A 0-2, enable is Port B bit 7). Added
`snd_hw_on` — interrupt-masked, ORs PA0-2 = 7 and ANDs PB7 = 0 once at boot,
never touching PA4 (overlay) or PB3-5/SR (ADB), so the SE input path is
undisturbed. Harness-verified (square wave reaches the buffer, PB7=0,
volume=7); needs a hardware ear-check on the SE.

## [macplus: validated on real Mac SE hardware] - 2026-06-13

**The standalone Mac OS now boots and runs on a real Mac SE** (via
FloppyEmu) — boot chain, desktop, and the ROM-assisted ADB input path all
live on hardware. Getting there meant fixing two faults the emulators never
surfaced; they boot through a far more initialised low-memory environment
than a bare ROM-assisted boot. Same `unodos_macplus.dsk` boots Plus and SE.

### Fixed: `FAULT @ 00403F72` / `ACCESS 00000005` on the SE
The first `_GetOSEvent` of each main-loop pass walked the ROM's
`EventQueue` ($14A), which is uninitialised on a System-less boot —
`qHead` held garbage `$FFFFFFFF`, so the ROM's queue scan computed
`$FFFFFFFF + 6 = $00000005` (odd) and address-errored inside ROM. We now
initialise the OS Event Manager in the ROM-assisted boot path: point
`SysEvtBuf` ($146) at a 20-record event pool (22 B each, free-marked with
`evtQWhat = $FFFF`), set `EvtBufCnt` ($154), and clear `EventQueue` to
empty. Buffer layout read directly from the SE ROM's `PostEvent`, so the
ADB also posts keys/mouse into it. Root-caused by disassembling the SE ROM
at the fault PC and verified against it in Unicorn (`qHead = 0` takes the
empty-queue branch and never reaches the faulting load).

### Fixed: ADB input dead on the SE (mouse + keyboard)
With the desktop up, ADB was silent. Two causes: (1) autopoll self-chains
through each transaction's completion interrupt, and our long
interrupt-masked boot breaks the chain — fixed by calling `_ADBReInit`
($A07B) once interrupts are enabled. (2) The mouse was read from
`RawMouse` ($82C), but the SE ADB mouse handler accumulates deltas into
`MTemp` ($828) and leaves the `MTemp → RawMouse` copy to the VBL cursor
task, which we disable to paint our own cursor — fixed by reading `MTemp`
directly with our own clamp + write-back. Keyboard latency also tightened:
the idle loop drains the ROM `EventQueue` ($14C) immediately rather than on
the once-per-second refresh. SE input low-mem map: button = `MBState`
($172), mouse = `MTemp` ($828), keys = `EventQueue` ($14A) via
`_GetOSEvent`.

### Preventive ROM-VBL hardening (ships alongside)
The chained ROM level-1 handler's per-tick work assumes System-level init.
Pre-empted so it can't fault once `_GetOSEvent` stops crashing and the VBL
actually runs: the ROM cursor task is disabled (`CrsrCouple`/`CrsrNew` at
$8CF/$8CE = 0 — we paint our own cursor) and the stack-into-heap sniffer is
satisfied by pointing `ApplZone` ($2AA) at a zeroed fake zone.

### Crash-dump fault screen
Bus/address/illegal faults now paint a full dump — PC, faulting access
address, SSW (bit 4 = read/write), the opcode word (IR), and all
D0-D7/A0-A7 — instead of just the PC. This is what made finding #2
diagnosable from hardware alone.

### Fixed earlier: Sad Mac `0F/00000001` at boot (BootDrive)
The boot block and `sony.i` hardcoded `ioVRefNum = 1`, but FloppyEmu on
the SE's external port enumerates as drive 2/3, so the read hit the empty
internal drive. Now honors low-mem `BootDrive` ($210) in both layers, and
the read-fail paths raise distinctive Sad Mac minors ($42 = kernel read
failed, $43 = `UDM1` magic missing) instead of the ambiguous `1`.

## [macplus milestone 3: FULL APP PARITY] - 2026-06-12

The standalone Mac OS now carries the complete shared UnoDOS app roster —
the same 11 apps as the Amiga, Genesis, hosted-Mac and x86 ports — plus
sound and the cooperative scheduler. Everything below is harness-verified
(4 regression scripts); the sound ear-check is a real-hardware item.

### Sound (snd.i)
The classic Mac pulse-width buffer: 370 words at MemTop−$300 scanned at
22.257 kHz, high byte per word = sample; the low bytes (the .Sony
variable-speed disk PWM) are never touched. Square synth converts the
shared Paula note periods (period/40); gm_* game-music sequencer with
PAL→60 Hz tempo rescale. Machine-gated: Plus = VIA PB7 + volume control,
SE = buffer-only, Mac II class = disabled (ASC).

### Games: Dostris (proc 5), Pac-Man (6), OutLast (7)
Verbatim logic, tables and AI from the Amiga port with deliberate 1-bit
schemes: Dostris pieces in alternating dithers; Pac-Man ghosts identified
by body fill density (solid/50%/25%) with hollow-shell frightened mode;
OutLast's white road over medium/light dither grass parity. Gravity and
physics run as task ticks; tick_wanted defeats the idle gate only while a
game (or song) is live.

### Paint (8), Music (9), Tracker (10), Theme (11)
Paint with the platform's true gamut — the four dither inks — and
byte-exact PAINT.UNO round-trips; Music plays Canon in D on the square
voice with background playback; Tracker edits the byte-identical shared
pattern format with leftmost-voice playback (the x86 PC-speaker model)
and SONG.UNO persistence; Theme selects dither schemes through the
now-mutable pat_tab — six presets including a full video invert, applied
live with a whole-screen repaint as the preview.

### Cooperative scheduler (scheduler.i)
Port of the Amiga scheduler with the Genesis key yield-retry: task 0 is
the kernel; every window runs its app proc in a private-2KB-stack task
(stacks at $3C000, below the disk-app region; StkLowPt cleared so the
ROM stack sniffer stays quiet in ROM-assisted mode). Keys post to the
focused task's one-slot mailbox; frame ticks drive the games in task
context. task_body re-derives the proc per event after a real bug: the
cached-register approach broke when Theme's repaint_all counted windows
in the same register.

### Kernel
Large buffers (Paint canvas, FAT caches, Notepad buffer, game state)
moved out of the image to fixed-RAM KBSS equates ($30000+), zeroed at
boot — image ~30 KB and every vars label safely pc-relative. pat_tab is
mutable (Theme); clear_screen derives the desktop fill from it.

## [macplus milestone 2: floppy filesystem + Files/Notepad + disk apps] - 2026-06-12

### macplus: the UnoDOS floppy filesystem (M2)

The standalone Mac OS gains storage. Past the kernel image, the 800K boot
floppy now carries a plain **FAT12 volume** (at sector 256) — the same
on-disk layout the x86 reference port uses, so the disk is PC-readable.
The kernel reads *and writes* it through the ROM .Sony driver via the same
`_Read`/`_Write` A-traps the boot blocks use (`sony.i`, a flat 512-byte
logical-sector device), driving the portable 68K FAT12 core (`fat12.i`)
shared with the Amiga port.

- **Files** (proc 2) lists the root directory — arrows select, Enter opens
  a file in Notepad, `r` re-mounts/refreshes. The volume is lazily mounted
  the first time the window paints.
- **Notepad** (proc 3) views and edits text with caret/line navigation and
  vertical scroll; **Clr** (the M0110A keypad clear, raw `$50`) saves the
  buffer back to the floppy via `fat_save_file` (a real `_Write`). Verified
  round-trip: edit → save → close → reopen reads the change back from disk.
- App keys now route to the topmost window's handler (`WPROC`), wired into
  the main loop's event drain.

### macplus: disk-loaded app binaries

The launcher can run an app *image* read off the floppy, exactly as the x86
launcher loads `.BIN`s. `DEMO.APP` is a standalone, position-independent
68K binary on the FAT12 volume; the kernel reads it into `$40000` and calls
its entry for each window event (`d0=0` draw / `d0=1` key), handing it
`a5` = a **ksys service table** (`draw_string`, `fill_rect`,
`fat_find_file`/`fat_read_file`, `get_ticks`, …) so the app holds no
absolute kernel addresses. `diskapp.i` is the loader + ABI glue,
`demo_app.asm` the sample app.

### macplus: harness + build

The ROM-free Unicorn harness now emulates `_Write` ($A003) as well as
`_Read`, so the entire filesystem path runs without an Apple ROM;
`tests/m2.script` is the M2 regression (mount, list, open, edit, save,
persist, then load the disk app and drive its key handler). `mkfs.py`
writes the FAT12 volume (the `disk/*.TXT` content plus the assembled
`DEMO.APP`) into the image after `mkdisk.py` packs the boot blocks + kernel.

## [Mac SE/II support + platform-authentic chrome] - 2026-06-12

### macplus: machine-adaptive input + Mac II geometry

The standalone Mac OS now runs across the whole compact-Mac span, not just
the Plus. At boot the kernel reads the ROM version word (`ROMBase+8`) and
picks its input strategy: Plus (`$75`) keeps the self-owned M0110 keyboard
and SCC quadrature mouse; **SE and later** switch to *ROM-assisted mode* —
chain the ROM's level-1 handler (its ADB stack stays alive) and mirror the
low-memory state it maintains (`Ticks`, `RawMouse`, `MBState`, the OS event
queue via `SysEvtMask` + `_GetOSEvent`). The Mac II class gets a 640×480
geometry build (`./build.sh mac2`); the default 512×342 image boots Plus
**and** SE unchanged. Validated in a self-built Mini vMac II with a real
IIcx ROM (boot, drag, full ADB keyboard) — the same path the SE will use.

### Platform-authentic window chrome

Each port's chrome now matches its native look:

- **Macs** (standalone + hosted System 7/Classic): System 7 chrome — drop
  shadows, pinstriped active-only title bar, square close box on a white
  patch, centered title.
- **Amiga**: Workbench look — blue drag bar with white left-aligned title
  when active / white bar when inactive, orange-centered close gadget.
- **x86**: already platform-authentic — the `widget_style` system renders
  Windows-3.x 3D bevels on VGA and a flat 4-color variant on CGA/8088.

Shared fix: opening a second window now repaints all windows so the
previously-active one loses its active-state title styling.

### Roadmap

Apple II and Apple IIGS ports added to the roadmap (TODO.md) — not started.

## [MacPlus standalone OS, milestone 1] - 2026-06-12

### New port: UnoDOS as a real OS on compact 68000 Macs (macplus/)

The Mac line is now a true operating system, not a Toolbox application.
Custom boot blocks ('LK'/$4418, position-independent) are bootstrapped by
the Mac ROM — the exact analog of the BIOS bootstrapping the x86 port —
and pull the kernel off raw floppy sectors with a single .Sony _Read,
the only ROM service UnoDOS uses. The kernel owns the machine: own
stack, own vector table, VIA CA1 tick, M0110/M0110A keyboard driver over
the VIA shift register (Instant-poll protocol, $79 prefix decoding),
SCC DCD quadrature mouse driver, 1-bit 512x342 renderer with dither
"colors", software save-under cursor, and fault screens. Milestone-1
scope: desktop, icons, full window manager (raise/drag/close/z-order,
incl. the tst-before-rts click guard), SysInfo + Clock.

Because Mini vMac/MAME need copyrighted Apple ROMs, the port ships a
ROM-free verification harness (macplus/harness.py): a Unicorn/QEMU 68000
core where the harness plays the ROM — Start Manager, A-line _Read
against the disk image, register-level VIA/SCC emulation, PNG
screenshots, scripted mouse/keyboard. The whole M1 surface is verified
through real injected input (tests/m1.script). Real-hardware validation
pending (quadrature polarity + keyboard cadence are the flagged
calibration points).

Fixed during bring-up: kb_byte dropped key events whose canonical raw
code had no ASCII (arrows) — `or.b` set flags on the low byte only and
the following beq bailed; same flags-vs-branch family as the
find_window_at click-through bug. An explicit tst.w now guards it.

## [Window-click fix + Paint polish] - 2026-06-12

- **Click-through bug fixed (Genesis + Amiga)**: `find_window_at`
  returned window HITS with stale condition flags (the final bounds
  compare is negative for any hit), so the caller's `bmi` sent every
  window click to the desktop. Latent since milestone 1 on both
  bare-metal 68K ports — the AUTOTESTs drive key handlers directly
  and only ever clicked a desktop icon, so the first real window
  click happened on physical Genesis hardware. Fixed with an
  explicit `tst.w d2` at the routine's exit; AUTOTEST_CLICK now also
  closes a window through its close box as the regression guard.
- Paint's canvas is now **white** (the MacPaint expectation) on
  Genesis, Amiga and x86; default pens adjusted to stay visible.
- Genesis pad-first controls and labels: Files X = delete, Tracker
  X = clear cell, Paint Y = next tool / X = next pen; footers name
  pad buttons (bare letters = soft-keyboard taps).

## [Cross-platform parity wave 2] - 2026-06-12

### Paint everywhere, Tracker everywhere, Mac multitasking + PC disks

- **Paint on all five targets** - the MacPaint-style editor (tool
  palette, drag-to-draw canvas with byte-per-pixel backing store,
  pencil/brush/eraser/line/rect/filled-rect/oval/filled-oval/flood
  fill/spray) with a per-platform "all the colors" selector: 256
  8-bit colors (Mac 7), authentic 1-bit dither patterns (Mac
  Classic), all 4096 OCS colors via live copper pen tuning (Amiga),
  all 512 colors via CRAM tuning (Genesis), and the active mode's
  full palette incl. a 256-color VGA picker (x86). One shared
  Bresenham/scanline-oval/flood design; a real e2-reuse Bresenham
  bug was caught by the Genesis AUTOTEST and fixed on every port.
- **Tracker on x86 + Mac** - every platform now has the 32x4 pattern
  editor with the byte-identical SONG.TRK format (PC speaker plays
  the leftmost voice; the Mac drives up to four Sound Manager square
  channels). QEMU-verified playback on x86.
- **Mac cooperative multitasking** (milestone 3): per-window tasks
  with a 68K asm context switch, heap stacks, one-slot mailboxes -
  both Mac targets, same semantics as the Amiga/Genesis schedulers.
- **Mac PC-compatible floppy**: FAT12 read/write core over an
  injectable block device (.Sony raw sectors on real SuperDrives; a
  RAM image under Executor); Files gains an HFS <-> PC disk volume
  toggle and Notepad round-trips files. The core's output image was
  verified byte-for-byte with an independent FAT12 parser.
- Genesis port validated on real hardware (2026-06-12).
- Known issue filed: the x86 launcher's 16-icon table includes its
  own Refresh slot, so only 15 apps fit; MOUSE.BIN/MKBOOT.BIN left
  off the default floppy as the workaround (still build from source).

## [Genesis milestones 3 + 5 + 6] - 2026-06-12

### Sega Genesis / Mega Drive: full Amiga-port parity (v0.2.0)

- **Theme app** (`genesis/theme.i`, proc 8): the 8 preset palettes
  shared with every other port, stored pre-converted to Genesis CRAM
  words ($0RGB → $0BGR, 3-bit channels — preset 1 reproduces the boot
  palette exactly), applied live by rewriting the themed entries of
  all four palette lines; r/g/b keys edit the active colors one 3-bit
  channel at a time, like the Amiga's 4-bit editor scaled to Genesis
  color depth. Game colors (entries 5-15) stay fixed.
- **Tracker** (`genesis/tracker.i`, proc 9): the Amiga 32-row ×
  4-channel pattern editor on the PSG — channels 1-3 are the square
  tone generators (PSG values = the ProTracker periods scaled by the
  clock ratio, so pitches match the Amiga within cents), channel 4 is
  the noise generator (the note picks the rate, hits decay per
  frame). The pattern format is byte-identical to the Amiga tracker,
  same demo song; `s`/`l` persist SONG.TRK in cartridge SRAM, `t`/`y`
  write/read the pattern over the tape interface (`tape.i` grew
  parameterized `tape_save_blk` / `tape_load_core` engines).
- **Sega CD backup RAM, Mode 1** (`genesis/bram.i`, milestone 5): the
  cartridge boots the CD attachment as a peripheral — expansion probe,
  Kosinski-decompress the Sub-CPU BIOS out of the main BIOS ROM
  ($415800/$416000/$41AD00/$40D500 candidates), upload a ~300-byte SP
  stub at $6000, and speak a LIST/READ/WRITE/DELETE RPC over the
  gate-array mailbox with file data staged through Word RAM. The stub
  calls the BIOS `_BURAM` traps, so files share the standard Sega
  directory with every other CD title and the console's own manager.
  Files app: `v` cycles SRAM ↔ BRAM; Notepad F1 saves to the active
  volume; UnoDOS 8.3 names normalize to 11-char BRAM names with the
  original name + byte length in a 14-byte payload header (foreign
  saves open raw). The transport is injectable per the port's
  standing rule: AUTOTEST_BRAM verifies the whole protocol + UI stack
  over a RAM-backed fake in BlastEm; the BIOS-trap path needs a
  CD-capable emulator or real hardware. Two emulator traps fixed
  along the way: BlastEm raises a 68000 **bus error** for $400000
  reads with no CD (real hardware returns open bus) — the probe arms
  a bus-error recovery vector that unwinds to the no-CD path; and the
  write-protect register write must be byte-wide to keep the
  bank/DMNA bits.
- **Cooperative scheduler** (`genesis/scheduler.i`, milestone 6 =
  the Amiga milestone 3): every window runs its app proc in its own
  task with a private 2KB stack ($FF4000 block) and a one-slot
  mailbox; the kernel task pumps input, drag, audio services and
  desktop. Keys post with a bounded yield-retry (`task_post_key`) so
  soft-keyboard and PS/2 bursts survive the single-slot mailbox —
  verified by the existing kbd/ps2 AUTOTESTs running unchanged
  through the task machinery, and by Dostris gravity ticking via the
  mailbox.
- Desktop grows to 10 icons (Theme reuses the x86 Settings art,
  Tracker the Music art); game/maze/actor tiles shifted +8.
- Genesis port version v0.1.0 → v0.2.0 ("Milestone 6"); test harness
  configs (WinUAE .uae files, autotest/snapwin scripts, Executor
  stage_run) re-pointed at the repo's current location.
- Verified in BlastEm 0.6.2: all 14 AUTOTEST builds re-run green
  (composite, notepad, music, kbd, ps2, click, dostris, outlast,
  pacman, sram, tape, bram, theme, tracker); Amiga AUTOTEST re-run
  green in WinUAE; Mac targets rebuilt clean (no source changes).

## [Genesis milestones 4 + 4.5] - 2026-06-11

### Sega Genesis / Mega Drive: storage — SRAM saves and tape/WAV

Storage architecture (all four tiers) documented in
docs/GENESIS-STORAGE.md; Sega CD backup RAM (Mode 1 + BIOS BURAM) and
SD-over-SPI are spec'd there for later milestones.

- **Cartridge SRAM** (`genesis/sram.i`): 8KB battery-backed, declared
  in the ROM header ("RA" $F8 $20, odd bytes at $200001), with the
  USV1 mini-filesystem: 8 directory entries + byte heap,
  save-by-name overwrite, delete with heap compaction. New **Files
  app** (proc 7, 8th desktop icon): list/open/delete; **Notepad F1**
  now saves for real (UNTITLED.TXT for new buffers, the source name
  for opened ones). Verified in BlastEm: save → wipe → reopen round
  trip (AUTOTEST_SRAM). Two traps: SRAM indexing must use `(a0,d0.w)`
  (a stale high word in a `.l` index wanders off-bus), and `$A130F1`
  is written once at boot — per-access toggling left SRAM unmapped
  under BlastEm (open-bus $FF reads that cascaded into a wild copy
  and a stack smash, diagnosed by the new on-screen exception dump).
- **Tape / WAV over audio** (`genesis/tape.i`): the classic 1-bit
  tape interface — the console has no ADC, so reads go through a
  one-comparator adapter (port 2 pin 1) and writes need no hardware
  at all (the PSG plays KCS 1200-baud AFSK out the headphone jack).
  Poll-count timebase, ~20s per 2KB. The bit/block decoder is an
  injectable pure routine, emulator-verified by AUTOTEST_TAPE
  ("HELLO FROM THE TAPE DECK" decoded through the real state
  machine). `genesis/mktape.py` is the PC tape deck: file→WAV encode,
  WAV→file decode (same state machine), selftest; a 2047-byte WAV
  round trip is byte-exact. Files app: `w` writes the Notepad buffer
  to tape, `r` loads a block back.
- `err` now renders the exception stack frame in hex on the bottom
  row (magenta-border beacon + faulting PC) — on-screen forensics
  for a platform with no debugger stdin.

## [Genesis milestone 2] - 2026-06-11

### Sega Genesis / Mega Drive: the game ports

- **Dostris + OutLast** (`genesis/games.i`) and **Pac-Man**
  (`genesis/pacman.i`): the same piece tables, track/curve table,
  maze, three-ghost AI (Blinky direct / Pinky 4-ahead / Clyde hybrid,
  scatter-chase schedule, frightened mode with the eat chain), scoring
  and physics as the x86 originals, rescaled from the donor Amiga
  ports' 50 Hz to the 60 Hz NTSC vblank.
- Cell rendering through `gcol`, a 32-entry map from the Amiga
  extended-palette indexes to (attr | solid-tile) name words on VDP
  palette lines 2/3 — converted channel-wise (Amiga `$0RGB` vs Genesis
  `$0BGR`). OutLast re-runs the donor's per-strip road math once per
  cell row in the same pixel space, so the curve/traffic/collision
  behavior is identical.
- **Pac-Man actors are hardware sprites** (1-4, chained after the
  cursor sprite): pixel-smooth motion over the cell maze with no
  repaint-under-actor logic at all — only eaten-dot cells redraw.
  Sprites park off-screen whenever the Pac-Man window isn't topmost.
- **Game music on PSG channel 1** (`gm_*`): Korobeiniki and Sunset
  Drive parsed from the x86 sources by `mkdata.py` into PSG tone
  values + 60 Hz durations; mutes (keeping position) when the owning
  game loses topmost, stops on close (PORT-SPEC §2).
- **Game-mode pad**: while a game window is topmost the d-pad posts
  arrow-key events (press + hold-repeat at ~15 Hz after 12 frames),
  A = Space, B = soft keyboard, C = Enter, Start = Esc, X = 'n',
  Y = 'p'. Desktop mouse behavior returns when a non-game window is
  topmost.
- Desktop grows to 7 icons in two rows (the game icons pulled from the
  x86 `.BIN` headers like the rest).
- Verified in BlastEm via three new AUTOTEST builds (dostris: six
  hard-drops through the key handler; outlast: 60 forced physics
  steps; pacman: 150 real AI steps).

## [Genesis milestone 1] - 2026-06-11

### Sega Genesis / Mega Drive: desktop, pad-mouse, soft keyboard, PS/2 wiring, Notepad + Music

- **Kernel** (`genesis/kernel.asm`): cell-based UnoDOS desktop on VDP
  plane A (H40, 40×28 cells; windows snap to the 8 px grid), four
  palette lines as the four themed UI attribute schemes, hardware-
  sprite cursor, window manager (drag/raise/close/z-order), 32-entry
  event queue + press-time click latch per PORT-SPEC §3/§6, app icons
  converted from the x86 `.BIN` headers. ISRs never touch the VDP
  except the status-read interrupt acknowledge.
- **Pad as mouse**: standard 3/6-button pad on port 1 — d-pad moves
  the cursor with held-time acceleration (Z = turbo), A = click/drag,
  B = soft keyboard, C = Enter, Start = Esc, X = Backspace, Y = Space.
- **Soft keyboard** (`genesis/softkbd.i`): kernel overlay (bottom 6
  cell rows) with full QWERTY, sticky Shift, F1, arrows, Esc; hover
  highlight; posts through the shared event queue with the Amiga-port
  raw codes, so the 68K apps stay byte-portable.
- **PS/2 drivers, wired for real hardware** (`genesis/ps2.i`):
  keyboard on port 2 (TH = CLK → EXT level-2 interrupt, 11-bit frame
  assembler, scancode set 2 with shift/break/E0), mouse on port 1
  (host-inhibit + per-vblank receive windows, boot-time `$F4` probe
  with pad fallback). Emulators don't model PS/2 on the control
  ports; the decode engines are injectable and the AUTOTEST_PS2 build
  verifies them end-to-end in BlastEm ("ps2 ok" typed, cursor moved
  by a synthetic stream packet).
- **Apps** (`genesis/apps.i`): SysInfo, Clock, Notepad (2 KB buffer,
  caret, line navigation with goal column, vertical scroll clamp,
  status bar), Music (PSG channel-0 square-wave sequencer, the shared
  Canon in D at 60 Hz, staff view with live note highlight).
- Verified in BlastEm 0.6.2 via AUTOTEST screenshot builds
  (composite/notepad/kbd/ps2/click); `genesis/README.md` documents
  controls, wiring, build matrix, and the real-hardware checklist.
- Bring-up traps recorded for posterity: the M0 vector table was off
  by two (the first vblank jumped to the error loop); vblank must be
  acknowledged with a VDP status read; a negative cell row shifted
  into a control word flips it into a CRAM write (the PROBE_GUARD
  build traps this and renders the caller PC on screen); a `movem`
  restore clobbering the just-found window slot index turned the
  z-list into a phantom-window CRAM sprayer.

## [Ports wave 3] - 2026-06-11

### Amiga: real storage + milestone 3

- **FAT12 driver, read + write** (`fdd.i`, `fat12.i`, `mkfat.py`):
  DF1 trackdisk DMA with Amiga-MFM sector decode and a track cache;
  full-track MFM encoder (headers, checksums, clock fixup) with
  one-revolution writes and a write-protect gate; FAT12 mount, root
  directory, chain reads, cluster alloc/free, dual-FAT flush, file
  create/overwrite. The 880KB data disk is plain-ADF-shaped (WinUAE
  serves it directly) and PC-interchangeable at file level via mtools.
  Files mounts DF1 ('m'); Notepad F1 saves to disk; Tracker s/l
  persists songs. Hardware notes: writes longer than one revolution
  wrap and destroy sector 0; the boot loader leaves DF0 selected with
  its motor on, which corrupts DF1 DMA until the driver quiesces all
  drives at init.
- **Milestone 3: cooperative scheduler** (`scheduler.i`): every open
  window runs its app proc as a task with a private 2KB stack;
  full-context task_yield, per-task event mailboxes (keys to the
  focused task, frame ticks to the topmost), spawn/kill tied to window
  create/close, ESC/close handled kernel-side. No app rewrites - the
  generic task body dispatches to the existing handlers. Verified:
  game gravity and the whole FAT12 save/reopen flow run through the
  task machinery.
- Mac milestone-3 scheduler remains open (needs C coroutines).

## [3.27.0] / [Ports wave 2] - 2026-06-11

One day after milestone 2, a parity wave across all three platforms.

### x86 (Build 406)

- **API 105 `theme_set_palette`**: 4 RGB entries (6-bit) into the VGA
  DAC via INT 10h AX=1010h; stored kernel-side and re-applied after
  every video mode switch (CGA mode 4 keeps its fixed palette).
- **Settings: "Theme (VGA)" section** - 8 preset palettes (Classic VGA,
  Midnight, Forest, Sunset, Ocean, Slate, Candy, Amber; shared with the
  68K ports) replacing the word-wrap demo.
- **Splash**: IBM PC art (CRT + desktop unit + keyboard), "UnoDOS 3" in
  the 8x14 font, "for IBM PC/XT/AT", ~2s minimum hold; progress
  segments narrowed so all 16 apps fit the bar.

### Amiga port (milestones 2.1-2.5)

- **32-color display**: 5 bitplanes (OCS lowres maximum), per-plane
  fill/char primitives, 32-entry copper palette - UI colors 0-3 stay
  theme-driven, 4-31 carry the extended game palette.
- **Theme app**: the 8 shared presets + per-channel custom RGB editing,
  applied live through the copper list.
- **Boot splash**: striped Amiga checkmark + "UnoDOS 3" at 2x.
- **Games**: Dostris, OutLast and Pac-Man ported from the x86 originals
  (same tables/physics/AI; Pac-Man uses incremental tile rendering).
  Game music: Korobeiniki + Sunset Drive on a Paula sequencer, parsed
  from the x86 sources by mkdata.
- **Tracker app**: write and play 4-channel MOD-style music -
  ProTracker periods, 32-row pattern editor, 4 chip-synthesized
  instruments, demo song. (.MOD file I/O lands with FAT12.)
- **Notepad**: up/down line navigation with goal-column memory +
  vertical scrolling.
- Desktop grows to 10 icons (two rows); games/tracker drive their own
  drawing (excluded from the 1 Hz app_ticks repaint).

### Mac ports (milestones 2.1-2.5)

- **True-color games** (color target): real RGB via 8-bit Color
  QuickDraw - the seven VGA piece colors in Dostris (16px cells),
  the full OutLast scenery palette in a 480x300 playfield (3/2 render
  scale over the faithful 320x200 game space), classic ghost
  identities in Pac-Man. Mono target keeps its 1-bit theme.
- **Theme app** (color target): the 8 shared presets + custom RGB.
- **Boot splash**: happy compact Mac + "UnoDOS 3" on both targets.
- **Games**: Dostris, OutLast, Pac-Man ported (same mechanics as x86);
  game music through the Sound Manager channel.
- **Files**: subdirectory navigation (PBGetCatInfo dirID walk,
  PBHSetVol current dir, ".." parent entry).

### Port-harness notes

- WinUAE/Executor autotest build variants play real moves at boot for
  screenshot verification (AUTOTEST_DOSTRIS/OUTLAST/PACMAN/TRACKER/
  THEME/NOTEPAD, UnoDOS7*Test targets).
- 68000 traps collected: divu needs a masked 32-bit dividend; addq is
  limited to 1-8; tst.w (pc) and (d16,An,Xn) are 68020+; transparent
  text over non-zero backdrops composes wrong colors.

## [Ports] - 2026-06-11

Platform ports, developed out-of-band from the x86 versioning (the x86
tree is unchanged). Spec: docs/PORT-SPEC.md; plan and feasibility:
docs/M68K-PORT-FEASIBILITY.md.

### Amiga port (amiga/, milestone 1-2)
- Bare-metal 68000 port for OCS/ECS A500-class machines: self-booting
  ADF (vasm + exe2adf), supervisor takeover, copper-driven 320x200x4 in
  the UnoDOS palette, hardware-sprite cursor, CIA keyboard + quadrature
  mouse into the focus-routed event queue (press-time click latch).
- Window manager: frames/title bars/close box, z-order with
  click-to-raise, clamped drag with self-erasing XOR outline.
- Apps: SysInfo, Clock, Files (boot ROM-disk browser), Notepad (caret
  editor, live Ln/Co/bytes status bar, F1 save-to-RAM), Music (Canon in
  D on a Paula square wave with staff view + playback highlight).
- Storage milestone stand-in: build-time ROM-disk from amiga/disk/
  (MFM/FAT12 driver is the next milestone).
- Verified in WinUAE with the built-in AROS ROM (no Kickstart needed).

### Mac ports (mac/, milestone 1-2)
- Two applications from one C codebase via Retro68: UnoDOS7 (System 7,
  Color QuickDraw, Mac II+, full UnoDOS palette) and UnoDOSClassic
  (System 1-6, 1-bit QuickDraw, Mac Plus/SE/Classic, authentic mono
  theme). Toolbox-based by design: one full-screen GrafPort, UnoDOS's
  own WM/widgets/theme inside it; ROM supplies screen, events, files,
  sound, ticks.
- Apps: SysInfo, Clock, Files (File Manager directory listing), Notepad
  (caret editor, live status bar, Cmd-S save via the File Manager),
  Music (Canon in D on the Sound Manager square-wave synth).
- Verified under the ROM-free Executor emulator (no Mac ROM or System
  install needed); runs from the .bin on real hardware / Mini vMac /
  Basilisk II.

## [3.26.0] - 2026-06-11

### 8088/8086 Compatibility + Audit Backlog Complete (Builds 404-405)

This release completes every item from the post-audit backlog
(docs/AUDIT-HANDOFF-2026-06.md SS5): the OS now genuinely targets the
Intel 8088/8086 it always advertised, the cursor hide/lock race and the
interrupted performance wave are finished, all confirmed-but-unfixed
medium findings are fixed, and the dynamic regression scenarios were
re-run green against the new build.

### 8088/8086 Support (the OS now runs on a real PC/XT)

- **Kernel, all 16 apps, and the floppy boot chain assemble under
  `cpu 8086`** - 1,150+ non-8086 instruction sites rewritten
  (pusha/popa -> PUSHA86/POPA86 macros, movzx -> mov+xor, multi-bit
  immediate shifts -> repeated/CL shifts, imul-imm -> shift/add,
  push-imm -> push m16, dword stores -> word pairs). New
  kernel/cpu8086.inc macros; `cpu 8086` directives make any future
  regression an assembly error.
- **FAT16/IDE hard-disk driver is explicitly bracketed `cpu 386` and
  runtime-gated**: fat16_mount detects a pre-286 CPU via the FLAGS
  12-15 signature and refuses to mount, so floppy-only 8088 systems
  degrade gracefully. The HD boot chain (mbr/vbr/stage2_hd) remains
  386+ by design, as documented.
- **INT 0x80 dispatcher bitmap tests rewritten 8086-safe** (movzx+bt
  removed) - previously the FIRST syscall on an 8088 died.
- Dead ide_read_sector removed (never called; wrote ES:DI while
  documenting ES:BX; 386-only).
- README example app and APP_DEVELOPMENT docs updated for 8086-safe
  register saving.
- Note: verified instruction-clean by the assembler and behaviorally in
  QEMU; real-8088 hardware validation still needs 86Box/PCem or a
  physical XT (QEMU cannot emulate an 8088).

### Performance (completing the audit's interrupted wave 4)

- **cga_pixel_calc MUL eliminated** - the ~120-cycle (on 8088) 16-bit
  MUL per plotted pixel replaced with a 200-byte row LUT; benefits all
  CGA text, lines, icons, and sprites.
- **Mouse cursor sprite fast path** - CGA cursor rows drawn/erased with
  2-3 byte XORs instead of 8 call/push-pop/address-calc round trips
  per row.
- **Floppy multi-sector reads** - fat12_read now reads runs of
  physically-consecutive clusters with one INT 13h per track chunk
  (DMA-boundary safe, 3 retries) instead of one call + bounce copy per
  512-byte cluster: a 20KB app load is ~4 BIOS calls instead of 40
  (up to a full disk revolution saved per sector on real hardware).
- fat12_read bounce copy word-widened (rep movsw).

### Fixed - Input & Window Manager

- **Cursor hide/lock race closed** (cursor_protect_begin): IRQ12 could
  redraw the cursor between mouse_cursor_hide and the cursor_locked
  increment, leaving XOR droppings / stale save-under rectangles. All
  36 sites now take the lock atomically.
- **IRQ12 no longer draws the cursor inside the interrupt handler** -
  no VRAM walking or VESA INT 0x10 bank switching at IF=0; the ISR sets
  a dirty flag and the redraw happens in task context (event_get /
  mouse_get_state), shrinking worst-case interrupt latency from
  potentially milliseconds to microseconds.
- **Keystrokes no longer leak across focus changes** - INT 9 stamps the
  focused task into each key event at PRESS time; stale keys whose
  target lost focus are discarded, and keys typed during an app launch
  no longer arrive in the new app. kbd_getchar (API 11) is focus-gated.
- **Mouse clicks land where they were CLICKED** - the IRQ latches
  press-time X/Y + a sequence number; API 28 returns them (SI/DI/AH/AL)
  and the launcher hit-tests the latch, fixing wrong-icon clicks during
  fast click-and-move and lost press+release pairs between polls.
- **EVENT_MOUSE posted only on button-state change and focus-routed** -
  motion no longer floods the queue, and background tasks can no longer
  steal the focused app's click events (Music lost clicks to the
  launcher).
- **Click-to-raise works on the window BODY** (was title-bar only) via
  a new z-aware hit test.
- **Window drag clamped** - the close button can no longer be dragged
  off-screen, and the desktop menu bar row stays visible.
- **Killing a task closes its file handles** (owner byte + reaper on
  all three kill paths) - the 16-entry file table can no longer leak to
  exhaustion, which blocked all app launching until reboot.
- **app_load validates file size** (0 / >=64KB / >0xFFE0 rejected, and
  short reads fail) instead of executing truncated or stale images.

### Fixed - Apps & Misc

- SysInfo uptime now measures time since BOOT (API 63 latches the BIOS
  tick counter at kernel entry) - it previously showed wall-clock
  derived values like "3054s" seconds after power-on.
- Notepad status bar (Ln/Col/byte count) updates while typing via a
  deferred dirty flag (no per-keystroke cost).
- FAT16 INT 13h extensions probed once at mount (AH=41h) and cached;
  CHS-only BIOSes skip the wasted AH=42h per sector, and stc before
  extended calls guards BIOSes that IRET without setting CF.
- PS/2 KBC fallback no longer pokes 8042 ports on pre-AT machines
  (BIOS model byte check) - saved ~3s of dead probing per boot on a
  real XT.
- Default make target now builds the bootable 1.44MB image (the 360KB
  image cannot boot: 1.44MB geometry is hardcoded).
- tools/qemu_test.py: Windows-native headless QEMU driver with
  position-tracked moveto (the old -2000 homing trick kills pointer
  motion on QEMU 11.x).

## [3.25.0] - 2026-06-11

### Full-System Audit & Stability Overhaul (Build 403)

A 116-agent audit (static analysis + adversarial verification + live QEMU
testing) produced 140 findings (97 confirmed, 25 observed dynamically). This
release fixes the confirmed critical/high findings across the scheduler,
window manager, event system, input drivers, graphics, and boot chain. Full
details: docs/AUDIT-HANDOFF-2026-06.md (handoff summary) and
docs/audit-2026-06-digest.md (every finding with verified patches).

### Fixed - Crashes & Memory Corruption

- **win_create drew its resize-grip pixels into the KERNEL CODE segment**
  (ES never set to video memory in win_draw_stub's grip block) — for some
  window geometries (e.g. 160x100) the four grip dots read-modify-wrote live
  kernel instructions; apps calling API 22 directly sprayed their own
  segment. Root cause of "random" crashes and corrupted window handles.
- **fat12_read popped one word too many** at .not_supported (7 pops for 6
  pushes) — any FAT12 read at file position != 0 returned through a
  corrupted stack and jumped to garbage. Also added a zero-byte/EOF fast
  path so read-until-0 loops terminate.
- **Kernel load was at 100% capacity with zero growth headroom** — kernel
  area expanded from 88 to 104 sectors (52KB) across the whole chain
  (stage2, BPB reserved sectors 94→110, add_floppy_fs.py, mkboot, fat12
  mount offsets — which were hardcoded, not BPB-derived). The kernel image
  pad now fails the build if the kernel outgrows the area.
- **ES was not part of the task context** — clobbered across every
  yield/context switch; cross-task segment corruption for any app holding
  ES across a syscall. Saved/restored on all five context paths.
- **Stale INT 0x80 dispatcher flags survived RETF app exit** — the next
  task resumed with the dead app's coordinate-translation/cursor-lock
  state, corrupting its registers. Flags now consumed one-shot.
- **mkboot wrote a stale filesystem size** (2810 sectors, three layouts
  old) — now derived from the layout constants.

### Fixed - Window Manager (create/destroy/z-order verified)

- **Z-order values drifted to 0 and collided** — every create/focus demoted
  all windows but destroy never renormalized, so after ~7 launch/close
  cycles hit-testing, painting, and promotion disagreed about stacking.
  Focus now demotes only windows above the raised one; destroy closes the
  z-gap. Invariant: visible windows hold dense distinct z {16-N..15}.
- **win_resize repainted only the desktop** — shrinking a window erased
  any window it overlapped. Now uses redraw_affected_windows like move.
- **win_focus (API 23) raised windows logically but never repainted** —
  stale title-bar states, stale pixels on top.
- **Resize-handle hit-test ignored occlusion** — clicking the body of a
  topmost window could start resizing a window underneath it.
- **Z-clipped WIN_REDRAW events left permanent holes** in background
  windows; **window titles overwrote the [X] close button** (now clipped).
- destroy_task_windows batches its repaint instead of a full
  promote/focus/redraw cycle per window.

### Fixed - Input & Events

- **post_event had no interrupt masking** — task-context posts raced
  IRQ1/IRQ12 posts and silently lost keystrokes/clicks exactly when window
  activity coincided with typing. Now pushf/cli...popf protected.
- **Single global event-queue head caused head-of-line blocking** — one
  task's pending event stalled keyboard/mouse for every task, then the
  31-slot queue filled and dropped input. event_get now forward-scans with
  tombstones; consecutive mouse events are coalesced at post time.
- **event_wait (API 10) / kbd_wait_key (API 12) busy-waited without
  yielding** — one blocked task froze the whole cooperative system.
- **Scancode table read out of bounds** for scancodes 0x60-0x7F.
- **XT (8255 PPI) keyboard acknowledge was missing** — on a real PC/XT the
  keyboard died after the first keystroke. Port 0x61 bit-7 pulse added.
- **Arrow/nav keys required E0 scancodes XT keyboards never send** —
  NumLock-aware routing of bare numpad codes 0x47-0x53 to the special-key
  map; NumLock toggle tracked, seeded from the BIOS flag byte.
- **IRQ12 swallowed keyboard bytes** when the KBC AUX bit was clear; mouse
  packet stream now self-heals after a lost byte (idle re-arm + sync-bit
  rejection); event_get no longer clobbers CX/DX on the no-event path.

### Fixed - Graphics (visual anomalies)

- **Default 8x8 font had a 12px advance** — all default text 50% wider
  than intended; primary cause of the boot-visible overlapping desktop
  icon labels (plus 10-char label truncation in launcher + kernel).
- **CGA scroll clear-all path fell through into VESA bank-switching code**
  — garbage fills + undefined INT 10h calls in the default video mode.
- **VESA scroll corrupted rows straddling 64KB bank boundaries**;
  vesa_fill_rect skipped a bank when a row started exactly on a boundary;
  vesa_set_bank now honors the VESA window granularity.
- **Glyphs bled up to 7px past window borders** — draw_char/draw_char_inverted
  now enforce the clip rect at row/pixel level (char & wrap APIs included).
- **gfx_blit_rect copied forward regardless of overlap** (smearing) and
  produced black fills in VESA/mode-12h (read_pixel unimplemented there).
- CGA fill/clear fast paths gained screen-bounds clamping; CGA scroll no
  longer smears up to 3 pixel columns outside non-4-aligned regions.
- VESA mode queries no longer clobber the system clipboard at 0x9000:0.

### Fixed - Desktop

- Kernel desktop icon table sized for the launcher's 40 icons (was 16) with
  bounds-checked registration; icon names NUL-terminated; label dirty-rects
  sized to real label width; icon 0 selected at boot.

### Performance

- gfx_fill_color CGA path: hybrid fill (masked edges + rep stosb middle)
  replaces per-pixel plotting for misaligned fills — ~10-40x faster window
  repaints in the default mode (partially applied; see handoff doc).
- 8px font advance removes the 4-gap-pixel-per-char fill (~33% fewer plots
  per character system-wide).

### Tooling & Tests

- tools/qemu_test.sh: headless QEMU driver (keyboard/mouse injection +
  screenshots) used for all regression testing.
- tools/to8086.py + kernel/cpu8086.inc: mechanical 186+/386+ → 8086
  instruction rewriter and macro library for the planned 8088 compatibility
  pass (audit found 1153 non-8086 sites; see handoff doc for the plan).

### Known Remaining Work

See docs/AUDIT-HANDOFF-2026-06.md — notably: the 8088 conversion has NOT
been applied yet (the OS still requires a 386+ despite the README claim),
the cursor hide/lock race fix (35 sites) is pending, and several confirmed
medium findings remain open.

## [3.24.0] - 2026-06-10

### Heap Allocator Overhaul (Builds 401-402)

The kernel heap was unusable since the kernel outgrew 16KB: the heap segment
(0x1400) overlapped the kernel image (0x1000:0000, now 44KB), so the first
`malloc` corrupted live kernel code — and three further bugs meant it never
successfully returned memory anyway. This release relocates the heap and
makes malloc/free actually work.

### Fixed (Build 401) - Heap Relocation

- **Heap overlapped the kernel image** — heap segment moved from 0x1400
  (linear 0x14000, inside the 44KB kernel at 0x10000-0x1AFFF) to a dedicated
  segment 0x8000 (linear 0x80000, 60KB). The kernel can now grow to its full
  64KB segment without colliding with the heap. New `HEAP_SEGMENT`/`HEAP_SIZE`
  constants in kernel/kernel.asm replace hardcoded values.
  - Root cause: v3.6.0 documented moving the heap to 0x1600 when the kernel
    grew past 16KB, but the code change was never applied; the kernel has
    since grown to 44KB (88 sectors), deepening the overlap.
- **First-fit size check used signed comparison** (`jge`) — the initial
  0xF000-byte (60KB) free block read as negative, so `mem_alloc` always
  returned NULL (while still corrupting the kernel via heap lazy-init).
  Changed to unsigned (`jae`).
- **`heap_initialized` flag read/written through the heap segment** — the
  flag is kernel data, but DS points at the heap when it is accessed; now
  uses `cs:` segment overrides.

### Changed (Build 401)

- **User app segment pool reduced from 6 to 5 slots** (0x3000-0x7000);
  segment 0x8000 is now the kernel heap. Max concurrent user apps: 5 + shell.
  This was the only conflict-free placement: 0x2000 is the shell, 0x9000 is
  the scratch/clipboard segment, low memory holds the kernel stack, and any
  segment below 0x2000 collides with kernel growth.

### Documentation (Build 401)

- Memory maps updated in README.md, docs/MEMORY_LAYOUT.md,
  docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, docs/FEATURES.md, docs/API_REFERENCE.md,
  docs/APP_DEVELOPMENT.md
- Corrected stale kernel size (28KB → 44KB, 56 → 88 sectors, disk layout
  sectors) in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, docs/bootloader-architecture.md,
  docs/boot-debug-messages.md

### Verification

- New QEMU harness in test-artifacts/heap/: a test app (run as LAUNCHER.BIN)
  exercises INT 0x80 API 7/8, then run_heap_test.sh inspects guest memory via
  the QEMU monitor — heap block headers at linear 0x80000, and the old heap
  site 0x14000 compared byte-for-byte against build/kernel.bin to prove the
  kernel image is no longer modified.

## [3.19.0] - 2026-02-16

### Added (Builds 202-212) - FAT12 Write, GUI Toolkit, Settings Persistence

- **FAT12 Write Support** (Build 202)
  - `fs_create_stub` (API 45) — Create new file on FAT12 floppy
  - `fs_write_stub` (API 46) — Write data to open file
  - `fs_delete_stub` (API 47) — Delete file from FAT12 floppy
  - `fs_write_sector_stub` (API 44) — Write raw sector to disk
  - Full FAT12 cluster chain allocation for multi-cluster files

- **Boot Floppy Creator (MkBoot)** (Builds 202-204)
  - New app: creates bootable UnoDOS floppy from running system
  - Pre-reads apps to RAM, prompts for disk swap, writes boot+kernel+apps
  - Floppy-to-floppy copy workflow for users without build tools

- **GUI Toolkit Foundation** (Build 205)
  - Multi-font system: 4x6 small, 8x8 medium, 8x14 large fonts
  - `gfx_set_font` (API 48), `gfx_get_font_metrics` (API 49)
  - Word-wrap text drawing: `gfx_draw_string_wrap` (API 50)
  - Widget APIs: `widget_draw_button` (51), `widget_draw_radio` (52), `widget_hit_test` (53)
  - Clip rectangle system for constraining drawing operations

- **Settings App** (Builds 206-210)
  - Font selection (small/medium/large) with live preview
  - Color theme: text color, desktop background, window color (4 CGA colors)
  - Color swatch picker with radio buttons for font selection
  - Apply/OK/Defaults buttons
  - Settings persist to `SETTINGS.CFG` on boot floppy via FAT12 write APIs
  - Kernel loads settings at boot before launching apps

- **Color Theme System** (Builds 208-209)
  - `theme_set_colors` (API 54), `theme_get_colors` (API 55)
  - `draw_bg_color` for text background rendering
  - Desktop background color, window frame color, text color all configurable

### Fixed (Builds 202-212)

- **Disappearing Windows** (Build 211): Drawing APIs 0 (pixel), 1 (rect), 2 (filled rect) didn't hide mouse cursor during drawing. IRQ12 could XOR the cursor over window frame pixels between API calls, progressively corrupting borders. Fixed by adding cursor_hide/cursor_locked to all drawing APIs.
- **MkBoot Window Redraw** (Build 211): MkBoot defined `API_WIN_DRAW equ 30` but the correct value is 22. API 30 is `mouse_is_enabled`, so the window redraw call was silently doing nothing.
- **draw_bg_color Pollution** (Build 211): `draw_desktop_region` set `draw_bg_color` to desktop color but never restored it, leaking into subsequent window drawing operations.
- **fs_open_stub Mount Handle** (Build 210): Compared full 16-bit BX for mount handle routing, but callers set only BL. Dirty BH caused silent open failures. Fixed to compare BL only.
- **fs_readdir_stub Mount Handle** (Build 209): Same BX vs BL routing bug as fs_open_stub.
- **Button Text Overflow** (Build 210): `widget_draw_button` didn't clip label text to button bounds. Fixed by setting clip rectangle before drawing label.
- **Mouse Click Events** (Build 207): `event_get_stub` wasn't setting CF flag correctly for mouse events, causing click handlers to miss events.

### Changed (Builds 202-212)

- API table expanded from 44 to 56 function slots (APIs 44-55)
- CGA pixel plotting functions refactored: shared `cga_pixel_calc` helper saves ~100 bytes (Build 212)
- FAT12 stack cleanup comments updated from stale line numbers to descriptive labels (Build 212)
- File handle validation uses `FILE_MAX_HANDLES` constant instead of magic number 16 (Build 212)
- Coordinate translation in INT 0x80 handler now covers APIs 0-6 and 50-52 (widget APIs)

## [3.18.0] - 2026-02-16

### Added (Builds 194-201) - Splash Screen, Multitasking Fixes, Refresh Icon

- **Splash Screen with Logo** (Builds 196-201)
  - "U" logo drawn with white filled rectangles during boot
  - "UnoDOS 3" title and "Loading..." text displayed
  - Progress bar fills as apps are discovered from disk
  - Replaces blank/debug screen during launcher initialization
  - Fast CGA memory clear via REP STOSW (Build 200)

- **Floppy Refresh Icon** (Build 195)
  - Manual disk rescan icon appears as last desktop icon on floppy boot
  - 3.5" floppy disk shape (16x16 2bpp CGA bitmap)
  - Replaces automatic INT 13h AH=16h polling (caused constant floppy seeking)
  - Only shown when booted from floppy

- **Launch Error Feedback** (Build 195)
  - "Insert app disk" message for mount/file errors (codes 2, 3)
  - Error message auto-clears after ~2 seconds with desktop redraw

### Fixed (Builds 194-201)

- **File Browser HD Support** (Build 194): Browser now queries boot drive
  and saves mount handle, fixing blank listing on HD/CF/USB boot
- **Floppy Seeking Noise** (Build 195): Removed automatic floppy swap
  polling (INT 13h AH=16h) that caused audible seeking on IBM PS/2 L40
- **Music App Single Tone** (Build 197): App played one constant note
  instead of Fur Elise melody. Root cause: `app_yield_stub` didn't
  preserve general-purpose registers across context switches, so CX
  (note duration) was clobbered by the launcher. Fixed with pusha/popa.
- **App Launch Crash** (Build 198): Adding pusha/popa to yield broke
  new task startup — `popa` consumed return addresses instead of
  register values. Fixed by adding dummy pusha frame (8 zero words)
  to initial task stack built by `app_start_stub`.
- **Initial Context Switch Loop** (Build 201): `auto_load_launcher`
  did bare `ret` without `popa`, popping 0 from the dummy pusha frame
  instead of `int80_return_point`. This jumped to kernel entry (0x0000)
  in an infinite loop: boot → load launcher → ret to kernel → repeat.
  Fixed by adding `popa` before `ret` in both `auto_load_launcher` and
  `app_exit_common`.

### Changed

- Bootloader version updated from v0.2 to v3.18
- All boot diagnostic code removed (keypress wait, BIOS teletype,
  CGA white boxes, PRE/POST markers)
- Splash screen text uses transparent background (Build 199)
- Desktop/splash screen clear uses direct CGA REP STOSW (Build 200)

### Removed

- Kernel boot keypress wait
- Kernel BIOS teletype diagnostic output
- Kernel "PRE"/"POST" CGA diagnostic strings
- Launcher CGA diagnostic white boxes (marks 1-6)

---

## [3.17.0] - 2026-02-15

### Added (Builds 162-193) - Universal PS/2 Mouse via BIOS Services

- **BIOS PS/2 Mouse Driver** (Build 187+)
  - Uses BIOS INT 15h/C2xx services instead of direct KBC port I/O
  - INT 15h/C205 (init), C207 (set callback), C200 (enable)
  - Works with USB mice via BIOS legacy emulation (SMI-based)
  - FAR CALL callback handler (`mouse_bios_callback`) processes packets from BIOS
  - Falls back to direct KBC method if BIOS services unavailable

- **Robust KBC Mouse Init** (Build 185)
  - KBC output buffer flush (16-byte drain loop) before init
  - Keyboard interface disabled (0xAD) during mouse setup
  - Long timeout for ACK wait (~1 second via BIOS timer tick)
  - Mouse reset retried up to 3 times
  - Keyboard re-enabled (0xAE) on both success and failure

- **Boot Diagnostic** (Build 184+)
  - Mouse init result displayed at boot: B=BIOS, K=KBC, R/S/E=failure
  - Keypress wait after diagnostic for hardware verification

### Fixed (Builds 162-193)

- **USB Legacy Emulation Conflict** (Build 187): BIOS SMI handler was overriding
  direct KBC port writes, re-masking IRQ12 and disabling aux clock. Solved by
  switching to BIOS INT 15h/C2 services which work *with* the SMI handler.
- **BIOS Callback AH Corruption** (Build 188): `mov ah, bh` in X sign-extend
  overwrote the status byte stored in AH, breaking Y sign extension.
- **Callback Byte Order** (Build 192): Discovered via QEMU raw stack dump that
  BIOS pushes status,X,Y,0 before CALL FAR, making [BP+12]=status, [BP+10]=X,
  [BP+8]=Y, [BP+6]=padding. All previous convention assumptions were wrong.
- IRQ2 cascade unmask added for IRQ12 propagation (Build 186)
- Removed fragile auto-detection of callback byte conventions (Build 192)

### Changed

- Mouse driver architecture: BIOS services primary, direct KBC fallback
- Kernel alignment pad bumped (0x11A0 → 0x13A0) for new mouse init code

---

## [3.16.0] - 2026-02-14

### Added (Build 161) - Hard Drive Boot Support

- **Hard Drive Boot Verified** (Build 161)
  - Full MBR → VBR → Stage2_hd → Kernel boot chain tested
  - FAT16 filesystem on 64MB partition with all apps
  - Boots from hard drives, CF cards, and USB flash drives (via BIOS emulation)

- **Boot Drive Query API** (Build 161)
  - New API 43: get_boot_drive — returns boot drive number in AL
  - Enables apps to detect floppy (0x00) vs hard drive (0x80) boot

### Fixed (Build 161)

- Launcher now queries boot drive from kernel instead of hardcoding floppy
- Launcher uses correct mount handle for FAT12/FAT16 routing
- read_bin_header uses dynamic mount handle (was hardcoded FAT12)
- Floppy swap detection skipped when booted from hard drive
- fat16_read 32-bit arithmetic: sector calculation no longer truncates to 16 bits
- MUSIC.BIN added to HD image (was missing from create_hd_image.py)

### Changed

- API table expanded from 43 to 44 functions (get_boot_drive)
- Launcher detects boot media type automatically

- **Z-Order Window Management** (Builds 155-159)
  - Background windows blocked from drawing over foreground
  - Topmost window bounds cache for O(1) clipping
  - Active/inactive title bar visual distinction
  - Active: filled white title bar with black text
  - Inactive: black title bar with white text outline
  - Automatic title bar style update on focus change

### Fixed (Builds 151-159)

- Build 153: Floppy read retry logic for reliable loading on real hardware
- Build 154: App load error code diagnostic in launcher
- Build 155: Background windows losing content due to overzealous z-order clipping
- Build 157: Post-drag z-order — desktop icons and background frames showing through moved window
- Build 158: Per-draw-call z-order clipping (point-inside-topmost check)
- Build 159: Simplified to full background draw blocking (fixes multi-pixel bleed-through)

### Changed

- API table expanded from 41 to 43 functions (speaker_tone, speaker_off)
- Window drag: outline-based instead of content save/restore
- Draw API calls from background windows silently dropped (apps repaint on focus)
- Title bar style differentiates active vs inactive windows

---

## [3.14.0] - 2026-02-13

### Added (Builds 144-150) - Desktop Icons, Multi-App, Multitasking

## [3.13.0] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed (Build 135) - Text Width Measurement

- **gfx_text_width returned wrong values** - Was reporting 8px per character but draw_char advances 12px (8px glyph + 4px gap). Fixed to return 12px per character, matching actual rendering.
- **Clock content overflowed window** - "00:00:00" = 96px (8×12) but was drawn at X=22 in 108px content area. Repositioned to X=6 for proper centering.
- **Launcher help text caused white boxes** - "W/S/Arrows: Select" = 216px (18×12), far too wide for window. Removed help text from launcher.

### Added (Builds 127-134) - Mouse Cursor, Window Dragging, Drawing Context

- **XOR Mouse Cursor** - 8x10 arrow sprite drawn with plot_pixel_xor (self-erasing)

  - Byte-aligned save/restore with `min(old_bpr, new_bpr)` for cross-boundary moves
  - Apps don't need to redraw when their window is dragged

- **Window Drawing Context** (APIs 31-32) - Apps use window-relative coordinates
  - `win_begin_draw` activates context for a window handle
  - `win_end_draw` deactivates context
  - APIs 0-6 automatically translate BX/CX from (0,0)=content-top-left to absolute screen

- **Text Width Measurement** (API 33) - `gfx_text_width` returns string width in pixels

- **gfx_draw_string_inverted** (API 6) - Fixed to use caller_ds for string access
  - Was reading from kernel segment (DS=0x1000) instead of app's segment
  - Caused white garbage boxes when launcher drew help text

### Changed (Builds 127-134)

- API table moved from 0x0F00 to 0x0F80 (more code space)
- API count increased from 30 to 34 (functions 30-33)

- **'L' key handler** in keyboard demo
  - Press 'L' to trigger app loader test
  - Prompts to insert app disk
  - Loads and runs HELLO.BIN from disk

### Fixed (Build 008)
- **Keyboard ISR register corruption** - INT 09h handler was modifying DX register
  without saving/restoring it, causing display corruption on real hardware
  - Added push/pop dx to int_09_handler
- **Error code display position** - Error digit was drawn at X=100, overlapping with
  'I' in "FAIL". Moved to X=136 (after 11-character string)

### Fixed (Build 009)
- **App loader filename format** - fat12_open expects "HELLO.BIN" (with dot separator)
  but kernel was passing "HELLO   BIN" (raw FAT 8.3 format without dot)
  - Changed .app_filename to include dot separator
  - fat12_open parses the dot to split name/extension correctly
- **Dynamic build numbers** - Version and build strings are now generated from files
  - BUILD_NUMBER file contains current build number
  - VERSION file contains version string
  - Makefile generates kernel/build_info.inc before assembly
  - `make bump-build` increments build number for next build

  - Kernel calls app via far CALL
  - App returns via RETF with return code in AX
  - Apps can discover kernel API via INT 0x80 (returns ES:BX = API table pointer)

- Memory layout:
  - Kernel at 0x1000:0000 (28KB)
  - Heap at 0x1400:0000 (apps loaded here via mem_alloc)

- App table entry (32 bytes):
  - Offset 0: State (0=free, 1=loaded, 2=running, 3=suspended)
  - Offset 2: Code segment
  - Offset 4: Code offset (entry point)
  - Offset 6: Code size
  - Offset 8-10: Stack segment/pointer (for future multitasking)
  - Offset 12-22: Filename (8.3 format)

### Future Enhancements Prepared
- App table includes state field for cooperative multitasking
- Stack segment/pointer fields for context switching
- Priority field for future scheduler

  - Caused system hang after finding file
  - Fixed by adding `add sp, 2` for DS cleanup

- **LBA to CHS conversion in fat12_read** (Critical)
  - Original code used bitmasks instead of proper division
  - DH (head) was never calculated
  - ES segment wasn't set for INT 13h read
  - BX (buffer pointer) was clobbered during division
  - Fixed with proper formula matching fat12_open's working code

- **Simplified attribute reading in fat12_open**
  - Removed unnecessary ES segment override
  - DS is already 0x1000 in the search loop

### Changed
- **fat12_read() rewritten for multi-cluster support**
  - Now loops through cluster chain until EOF or all bytes read
  - Reads each cluster sequentially into bpb_buffer
  - Copies data to user buffer and advances pointer (ES:DI) automatically

### Technical Details
- FAT12 cluster chain algorithm:
  - Calculate FAT offset: `(cluster × 3) / 2`
  - Determine FAT sector: `reserved_sectors + (offset / 512)`
  - Cache FAT sector if not already loaded
  - Read 2 bytes from FAT at offset
  - If cluster is even: `value = word & 0x0FFF`
  - If cluster is odd: `value = word >> 4`
  - Check for end-of-chain: `value >= 0xFF8`

- LBA to CHS conversion for 1.44MB floppy (18 sectors/track, 2 heads):
  - Sector: `(LBA % 18) + 1`
  - Head: `(LBA / 18) % 2`
  - Cylinder: `LBA / 36`

### Hardware Verified
- ✅ Tested on HP Omnibook 600C (486DX4-75)
- ✅ Mount: OK
- ✅ Open TEST.TXT: OK
- ✅ Read: OK (multi-cluster)
- ✅ C1:A C2:B displayed correctly

### Testing
```bash
make test-fat12-multi      # Test with 1024-byte file
# Boot, press F, swap to test floppy
# Expected output: Mount: OK, Open: OK, Read: OK, C1:A C2:B
```

### Notes
- This release marks completion of FAT12 filesystem on real hardware
- Multi-cluster support enables loading applications larger than 512 bytes
- Critical foundation for Application Loader (v3.11.0)

## [3.7.0] - 2026-01-23

### Changed
- **Aggressive Kernel Optimization (Pre-Foundation 1.4/1.5)**
  - Removed test functions (test_int_80, test_graphics_api): ~200 bytes freed
  - Removed 21 character alias definitions (char_W, char_E, etc.)
  - Optimized all graphics API functions: replaced pusha/popa with targeted register saves
  - Optimized gfx_draw_rect_stub: eliminated ~80 bytes of redundant push/pop operations
  - Optimized plot_pixel_white: removed variable storage (pixel_save_x/y), stack-only implementation
  - Optimized setup_graphics: tighter BIOS call sequence
  - Optimized install_int_80: minimal register preservation
  - Welcome message now uses gfx_draw_string (string-based) instead of individual char draws

### Technical Details
- Kernel code: 2436 → 2416 bytes (20 bytes from optimization, ~200 from removal)
- Total space gained: ~220 bytes
- Available in 24KB kernel: **22,160 bytes** (sufficient for Foundation 1.4 + 1.5 + future features)
- Removed variables: pixel_save_x, pixel_save_y
- Removed test chars: test_W_char, test_eq_char
- Optimized functions maintain identical behavior, purely size/speed improvements

### Rationale
- Maximize space for Foundation 1.4 (Keyboard Driver ~800B) and 1.5 (Event System ~400B)
- Eliminate production overhead from debug/test code
- Optimize frequently-called graphics primitives
- Prepare for remaining Foundation Layer implementation

## [3.6.0] - 2026-01-23

### Changed
- **Kernel Expansion: 16KB → 24KB**
  - Kernel size increased from 16384 bytes (32 sectors) to 24576 bytes (48 sectors)
  - Provides headroom for Foundation 1.4 (Keyboard Driver, ~800 bytes) and Foundation 1.5 (Event System, ~400 bytes)
  - Heap start moved from 0x1400:0000 to 0x1600:0000
  - Available heap reduced from 540KB to 532KB (loses 8KB)

### Technical Details
- Modified boot/stage2.asm: KERNEL_SECTORS 32 → 48
- Modified kernel/kernel.asm: Final padding 16384 → 24576
- New memory layout:
  * 0x1000:0x0000 - Kernel (24KB, was 16KB)
  * 0x1600:0x0000 - Heap start (was 0x1400:0x0000)
  * ~532KB available for applications (was 540KB)
- Kernel headroom: ~7KB for future Foundation Layer components

### Rationale
- v3.5.0 reached exact 16KB capacity with Memory Allocator
- Foundation 1.4 and 1.5 require additional ~1200 bytes minimum
- 24KB expansion is conservative, leaves room for future enhancements
- 8KB heap reduction is negligible (still 532KB for apps)
- See docs/MEMORY_LAYOUT.md for detailed analysis

## [3.5.0] - 2026-01-23

### Added
- **Memory Allocator (Foundation 1.3)**
  - malloc(size): Allocate memory dynamically
  - free(ptr): Free allocated memory
  - First-fit allocation algorithm
  - Heap at 0x1400:0000, extends to ~640KB limit
  - Block header structure (size + flags)
  - Integrated with API table (offsets 6, 7)

### Technical Details
- Memory block header: 4 bytes [size:2][flags:2]
  * size: Total block size including header
  * flags: 0x0000 (free) or 0xFFFF (allocated)
- First-fit search algorithm for allocation
- Automatic heap initialization on first malloc
- Initial heap block: ~60KB (0xF000 bytes)
- 4-byte aligned allocations

### Implementation
- malloc(AX=size) → AX=pointer (offset from 0x1400:0000), 0 if failed
- free(AX=pointer) → frees memory block
- Heap starts at segment 0x1400 (linear 0x14000)
- Applications use ES=0x1400 + offset for memory access

### Size Impact
- Memory allocator: ~600 bytes
- Kernel size: Still 16KB (16384 bytes exact)
- Remaining capacity: ~0 bytes (at maximum)

## [3.4.0] - 2026-01-23

### Added
- **Graphics API Abstraction (Foundation 1.2)**
  - gfx_draw_pixel: Wraps plot_pixel_white for API table access
  - gfx_draw_char: Character rendering with coordinate parameters
  - gfx_draw_string: Null-terminated string rendering
  - gfx_draw_rect: Rectangle outline drawing
  - gfx_draw_filled_rect: Filled rectangle drawing
  - gfx_clear_area: Clear rectangular area (stub for now)

### Fixed
- Welcome message typo: "WELLCOME" → "WELCOME"

### Technical Details
- All graphics functions accessible via kernel API table
- Register-based calling convention:
  * gfx_draw_pixel(CX=X, BX=Y, AL=color)
  * gfx_draw_char(BX=X, CX=Y, AL=ASCII)
  * gfx_draw_string(BX=X, CX=Y, SI=string_ptr)
  * gfx_draw_rect(BX=X, CX=Y, DX=width, SI=height)
  * gfx_draw_filled_rect(BX=X, CX=Y, DX=width, SI=height)
- Kernel size: Still within 16KB limit

  - Kernel API table at fixed address 0x1000:0x0500
  - Hybrid approach: INT 0x80 for discovery + Far Call Table for execution
  - API table header with magic number ('KA' = 0x4B41), version (1.0), function count
  - 10 stub functions for future implementation:
    * Graphics API (6 functions): draw_pixel, draw_rect, draw_filled_rect, draw_char, draw_string, clear_area
    * Memory management (2 functions): malloc, free
    * Event system (2 functions): get_event, wait_event
- Visual test for INT 0x80 - displays "OK" at bottom right if successful

### Technical Details
- API table positioned at exactly offset 0x0500 (verified in binary)
- Follows Windows 1.x/2.x, GEOS pattern for performance
- Far Call approach saves ~40 cycles per call vs pure INT approach (~9% CPU at 4.77MHz)
