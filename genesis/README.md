# UnoDOS/Genesis — Sega Mega Drive / Genesis port

Bare-metal UnoDOS 3 desktop for the Sega Mega Drive / Genesis (68000 @
7.67 MHz, VDP tile graphics, 64 KB work RAM), built from the same
portable design as the Amiga and Mac ports (`docs/PORT-SPEC.md`).

**Milestone 1 (2026-06-11):** desktop with icons, window manager
(drag, raise, close, z-order), pad-as-mouse with a hardware-sprite
cursor, on-screen soft keyboard, PS/2 keyboard/mouse drivers (wired
for real hardware), Notepad, and the Music test app (PSG Canon in D).
Verified in BlastEm; **this port is headed for real hardware.**

## Display model

H40 (320×224 = 40×28 cells). Everything is composed on plane A as
(palette, tile) cells, so windows snap to the 8 px grid; the mouse
cursor is a hardware sprite and stays pixel-smooth. The four UI
attribute schemes (normal / inverted / accent / soft-key) are the four
VDP palette lines, each derived from the four UnoDOS theme colors —
a future Theme app restyles the whole port by rewriting CRAM.

## Controls (standard 3/6-button pad, port 1)

| Input | Action |
|---|---|
| D-pad | move the mouse cursor (accelerates while held) |
| A | click (hold to drag windows by their title bars) |
| B | show/hide the soft keyboard |
| C | Enter |
| Start | Esc (closes the topmost window) |
| X | Backspace |
| Y | Space |
| Z | hold for turbo cursor speed |

X/Y/Z need a 6-button pad; everything else works on a 3-button pad.
The soft keyboard covers the rest: full QWERTY, Shift (sticky), F1,
arrows, Esc — clicked keys post through the same event queue as a real
keyboard, with the same raw codes as the Amiga port, so apps are
byte-portable across the 68K family.

## PS/2 keyboard and mouse (real hardware only)

Per `docs/GENESIS-PORT.md`, PS/2 devices wire directly to the control
ports (passive adapter — the console supplies 5 V):

| DE-9 pin | MD signal | PS/2 signal |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | D0 ("Up") | DATA |
| 5 | +5V | +5V |
| 7 | TH | CLOCK |
| 8 | GND | GND |

- **Port 2 = keyboard**: TH raises the level-2 EXT interrupt on every
  clock edge; the handler assembles 11-bit frames and decodes scancode
  set 2 (shift, break and E0-extended codes handled).
- **Port 1 = mouse**: polled with PS/2 host-inhibit — CLK is held low
  except for a per-vblank receive window; 3-byte stream packets
  assemble across windows and decimate to the frame rate. At boot the
  kernel probes port 1 with `$F4` (enable reporting); if no ACK comes
  back it falls back to pad mode, so stock hardware just works.

Emulators do not model PS/2 devices on the control ports. The protocol
engines are injectable pure routines, so `./build.sh ps2` verifies the
whole decode path (bits → frames → scancodes/packets → events → apps)
in BlastEm; the physical wiring itself is a real-hardware test.

## Build

Needs vasm (`vasmm68k_mot`, the same binary as the Amiga port) and
Python 3. From this directory:

    ./build.sh            # build/unodos.gen (interactive)
    ./build.sh test       # AUTOTEST composite (notepad+music+soft kbd)
    ./build.sh notepad    # demo text + 6 up-arrows through notepad_key
    ./build.sh music      # Music app auto-started
    ./build.sh kbd        # soft keyboard clicks type "UNO" into Notepad
    ./build.sh ps2        # synthetic PS/2 streams through the decoders
    ./build.sh click      # double-click launch via the real click latch

`mkdata.py` regenerates `gen_data.i` from the shared x86 assets: the
8×8 font as 4bpp tiles, window chrome tiles, the cursor sprite, the
app icons (pulled from the x86 `.BIN` headers), the Canon in D note
table (PSG values, 60 Hz duration ticks), and the PS/2 scancode maps.

The ROM is 64 KB, TMSS-safe, region "JUE". Run it with BlastEm (or any
accurate emulator), e.g.:

    blastem build/unodos.gen

Bring-up probes (also useful on real hardware): `-DPROBE_NOINT=1`
draws the splash with interrupts off, `-DPROBE_INT=1` renders the live
tick counter, `-DPROBE_WIN=1` opens Notepad statically, and
`-DPROBE_GUARD=1` traps out-of-range cell coordinates and freezes with
the caller PC + coordinates rendered in hex on the bottom row.

## Architecture notes

- All VDP access happens in main-loop context; ISRs only update state
  (PORT-SPEC §6). The vblank ISR acknowledges the interrupt with a VDP
  status read — safe because every control-port write in the kernel is
  a single atomic `move.l`.
- The vblank ISR reads the pad (standard TH-toggle sequence, 6-button
  aware), applies d-pad movement to the cursor state, and latches
  press-time click coordinates with a sequence counter; `handle_clicks`
  consumes the latch in the main loop (PORT-SPEC §3).
- Events: one 32-entry queue, `EV_KEY` data = (raw<<8)|ascii with the
  Amiga port's raw codes (arrows `$4C-$4F`, F1 `$50`).
- Variables live at `$FF8000`, addressed `offset(a4)` — the RAM
  edition of the Amiga port's `vars(pc)` convention.
- No storage yet: Notepad's F1-save is a no-op until M5 (SRAM saves).

## Verified (BlastEm 0.6.2)

- boot → splash → desktop; icons render from the real x86 icon art
- window create/raise/close/drag, z-order, topmost-only refresh
- Notepad: typing, caret, line nav with goal column, vertical scroll
  clamp, status bar (`Ln 12 Co 14` after the six-up-arrow AUTOTEST)
- Music: PSG channel-0 sequencer playing Canon in D, staff view with
  the live note highlighted
- soft keyboard: hit-test → sticky shift → event queue → Notepad
  ("UNO" typed by the AUTOTEST)
- PS/2 decoders: "ps2 ok" typed via synthetic set-2 frames; a stream
  packet moves the cursor to the exact expected pixel
- click latch: synthesized double-click launches Music

Real-hardware checklist: PS/2 keyboard on port 2 (EXT interrupt),
PS/2 mouse on port 1 (inhibit/poll timing), pad feel (acceleration
tuning), TMSS on a model 3, PSG volume balance.
