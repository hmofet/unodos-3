; ============================================================================
; UnoDOS/Apple IIGS - block-0 boot stage (loaded by ProDOS block firmware).
;
; Contract (see iigs/HANDOFF.md SS2b): firmware reads block 0 of the boot
; device to $0800, verifies byte $0800 = $01, and JMPs $0801 in 6502
; EMULATION mode with X = slot<<4.  We:
;   1. derive the slot firmware's ProDOS block-driver entry = $Cn00+[$CnFF],
;   2. read kernel blocks 1..KBLOCKS to $00:2000 via that driver
;      (ProDOS device-driver call: $42=cmd, $43=unit, $44/45=buf, $46/47=blk),
;   3. switch to native mode (clc/xce, rep #$30) and JMP the kernel.
;
; The kernel itself enables Super Hi-Res; the boot stage only loads + hands
; off, so this code works against the REAL firmware and the harness's
; WDM-trap driver stub identically.  mkdsk.py patches KBLOCKS into the
; unique "CMP #$4B" below.
