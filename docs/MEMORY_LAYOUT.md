## Kernel Layout (0x1000:0x0000)

```
Offset    Content
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
0x0000    Signature ("UK") + entry point
0x0002    Kernel code (init, drivers, API stubs)
          - INT 0x80 handler
          - Keyboard driver (INT 09h)
          - PS/2 mouse driver (INT 0x74)
          - Graphics routines (pixel, rect, string, XOR)
          - Memory allocator (malloc/free)
          - Event system
          - FAT12 filesystem driver
          - Application loader with segment pool
          - Window manager (create, destroy, draw, focus, move, drag)
          - Mouse cursor (XOR sprite, hide/show, drag state)
          - Content preservation (save/restore scratch buffer)
          - Segment pool (alloc_segment, free_segment)
0x1100    API table (header + 105 function pointers)
~0x1084   Font data (8x8 + 4x6)
~0x1500   Data section (window_table, app_table, segment_pool, variables)
~0xAFFF   End of 44KB kernel (padded to 45056 bytes)

0x08    182   Function pointers (105 × 2 bytes)

## Segment Architecture

### Why Kernel at 64KB Boundary?

```
Segment:Offset = 0x1000:0x0000
Linear address = (0x1000 × 16) + 0x0000 = 0x10000 = 64KB
```

**Reasons:**
1. **Clean Segmentation** - Single segment (0x1000) covers entire kernel
2. **No segment manipulation** - DS, ES, CS all 0x1000 during kernel execution
3. **Room to grow** - Kernel can expand to the full 64KB segment (up to
   0x2000:0000) without colliding with the heap, which lives in its own
   dedicated segment at 0x8000 (moved there in Build 401; the old 0x1400
   heap overlapped the kernel image once the kernel grew past 16KB)
4. **Future compatibility** - Aligned for potential protected mode transition

### Multi-App Segment Architecture (Build 149+, pool reduced Build 401)

```
0x2000:0x0000  Shell (Launcher) - fixed, persists always
0x3000:0x0000  User app slot 0 (dynamic pool)
0x4000:0x0000  User app slot 1
0x5000:0x0000  User app slot 2
0x6000:0x0000  User app slot 3
0x7000:0x0000  User app slot 4
0x8000:0x0000  Kernel heap (removed from app pool in Build 401)
```

- Shell loads at 0x2000 (fixed), user apps allocated dynamically from pool
- Up to 5 concurrent user apps, each in its own 64KB segment
- `alloc_segment(task_handle)` finds free segment, marks owned
- `free_segment(segment)` returns segment to pool on task exit
- `segment_pool` (5 words) + `segment_owner` (5 bytes) track allocation state
- Apps use `[ORG 0x0000]` and are loaded at offset 0

### Scratch Buffer (0x9000)

Shared kernel buffer used for system services:
- **0x0000-0x0FFF**: System clipboard (4KB, used by clip_copy/clip_paste APIs 84-86)
- **0x1000+**: File dialog list buffer (used by file_dialog_open API 90)
- Size: up to 64KB
- Moved from 0x5000 to 0x9000 in Build 149 to free segment for app pool

## Current Memory Usage

| Region | Size | Usage | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|-------|
| 0x0500-0x7C00 | 30KB | Kernel stack | SS=0, SP grows down from 0x7C00 |
| 0x1000-0x1AFF | 44KB | Kernel | May grow up to 64KB (to 0x2000) |
| 0x2000-0x2FFF | 64KB | Shell segment | Launcher (fixed) |
| 0x3000-0x7FFF | 320KB | User app pool | 5 × 64KB segments |
| 0x8000-0x8EFF | 60KB | Heap | Available for malloc |
| 0x9000-0x9FFF | 64KB | Scratch buffer | Clipboard (4KB) + file dialog list |

**Overall:** 6 app segments (1 shell + 5 user) using 384KB of the 640KB address space.
