# UnoDOS feature matrix

How the targets compare, feature by feature. x86 is the reference
implementation; every other target is a port — the 68K/6502/65816 ports
are native rewrites against [PORT-SPEC.md](PORT-SPEC.md), and the PS2 /
Dreamcast ports reuse the portable C core ([../mac/unodos.c](../mac/unodos.c))
over a Mac-compat shim. Updated 2026-06-15 (x86 v3.31.0 build 420; the
new-ports program — Apple II, IIGS, SNES, PS2, Dreamcast — and the
standalone MacPlus OS are all at app parity).

Column key: **x86** = IBM PC reference (incl. the 8088 hardware-fidelity
build), **Amg** = Amiga, **M7** = Mac System 7 (hosted Toolbox), **M1-6** =
Mac System 1–6 (hosted Toolbox), **MacP** = MacPlus standalone OS
(bare-metal), **Gen** = Sega Genesis, **A2** = Apple II, **IIGS** = Apple
IIGS, **SNES** = Super Nintendo, **PS2** = Sony PlayStation 2, **DC** =
Sega Dreamcast.

## Maturity & verification

| Port | Status | Harness / emulator | Real hardware |
|---|---|---|---|
| **x86 PC** | reference, feature-complete | QEMU (scripted scenarios) | ✅ tested (8088→486, PS/2 L40, Eee PC) |
| **x86 8088/XT** | M0–M2 done, M3 mostly | MartyPC + GLaBIOS (cycle-accurate 8088) | ⏳ physical XT pending |
| **Amiga** | M3+ | WinUAE + AROS ROM (AUTOTEST builds) | ⏳ A500 smoke test pending |
| **Mac System 7** | M3 | Executor (ROM-free) | ⏳ Mac II-class pending |
| **Mac System 1–6** | M3 (minus color Theme) | Executor | ⏳ Mac Plus pending |
| **MacPlus (OS)** | M3, full app parity | Unicorn harness + Mini vMac / vMac II | ✅ real Mac SE (FloppyEmu) |
| **Sega Genesis** | M6+ | BlastEm (15 AUTOTEST builds) | ⚠️ boots on flashcart (2026-06-12); PS/2 / tape / Sega CD adapters not yet exercised |
| **Apple II** | M1–M3 done | py65 ROM-free harness; `.woz`/`.nib` built | ⏳ AppleWin/FloppyEmu (IIc) pending |
| **Apple IIGS** | M0–M3, full parity | from-scratch py65816 core, 9 suites green | ⏳ GSplus/KEGS/MAME + audio-ear pending |
| **Super Nintendo** | M0–M3 done | Mesen2 F12 captures | ⏳ flashcart + audio-ear pending |
| **Sony PS2** | M0–M3 done | PCSX2 (boot @60fps) | ⏳ real PS2; USB+audio coded but not emulator-exercisable |
| **Sega Dreamcast** | at parity | Flycast @60fps + VMU round-trip | ⏳ CD-R / dc-tool + audio-ear pending |
| **Sega Master System** *(3.1-fresh)* | M1–M3 + Dostris game + PSG audio | BlastEm (AUTOTEST scripted-pad builds) | ⏳ real SMS + audio-ear pending |
| **Nintendo NES** *(3.1-fresh)* | M1–M3 + Dostris + APU audio (`minimal` profile) | Mesen2 (software-render grab, AUTOTEST scripted-pad) | ⏳ real NES pending |
| **Game Boy / Color** *(3.1-fresh)* | M1–M3 + Dostris + APU audio (`minimal`, DMG+GBC colour) | Mesen2/GBC (software-render grab, AUTOTEST scripted-pad) | ⏳ real DMG/GBC pending |
| **Sega Game Gear** *(3.1-fresh)* | M1–M3 + Dostris + PSG audio (`minimal`, 12-bit colour) | Mesen2/GG (software-render grab, AUTOTEST scripted-pad) | ⏳ real GG pending |

The last four are built **fresh on the 3.1 contract-driven architecture** (not
legacy ports): SMS is a windowed Z80 port, NES is the `minimal`-profile 6502
launcher, Game Boy is the `minimal`-profile SM83 port — the first to add a *new*
generator dialect (`gbz80`/rgbds) — and Game Gear is `minimal` on SMS silicon,
reusing `gen/z80/` and the SMS code with the GB's 20×18 layout. They are not yet in
the per-feature grids below (which cover the mature legacy targets); see
[../sms/README.md](../sms/README.md), [../nes/README.md](../nes/README.md),
[../gb/README.md](../gb/README.md), and [../gg/README.md](../gg/README.md).

All retro/console ports flag **audio as an "ear-check"** pending real
hardware: the control path (SPC700 mailbox ack, Ensoniq DOC register log,
AICA/SPU2 synth) is asserted, but the actual sound output is verified on
metal, not in the harness.

¹ Apple II ships poll-and-dispatch; a per-task cooperative scheduler was
prototyped and proven (`scheduler.i`, `-DSCHED_PROTO=1`) but the
full-screen single-app model doesn't need a live scheduler.
² SNES is cooperative-by-ticks — a documented verdict: the 65816 bank-0
stack constraint leaves no room for per-task stacks, so every app's
`*_tick` runs from the main loop.

The 8 theme preset palettes (Classic VGA, Midnight, Forest, Sunset,
Ocean, Slate, Candy, Amber) are shared across every color-capable
platform; the Dostris/OutLast/Pac-Man ports share the x86 originals'
piece tables, track/physics and ghost AI byte-for-byte where the
platform allows. The Tracker pattern (32×4) is byte-identical on every
platform, though the on-disk filename varies (`SONG.TRK` on x86/Mac/
Genesis; `SONG.UNO` on Amiga/Apple II).

## 3D — Uno3D

A separate write-once 3D library ([../uno3d/](../uno3d/),
[UNO3D.md](UNO3D.md)) with a swappable per-platform rasteriser backend.
Three backends ship: **soft** (CPU → framebuffer, universal), **ps2-gs**
(GS hardware via gsKit, 60 fps in PCSX2), **dc-pvr** (PowerVR2 via KOS,
verified in Flycast). The x86 OS gets its own native 3D app
([../apps/runner3d.asm](../apps/runner3d.asm)) that draws through the
kernel's `INT 0x80` graphics API instead of the C library. Backend slots
for PS3 / PC / GameCube / Xbox are planned (comments only, not yet
implemented).

## UI toolkit — unoui

A separate write-once widget toolkit ([../unoui/](../unoui/),
[UNOUI.md](UNOUI.md)) for the C-based ports + host — the look-and-feel
analogue of Uno3D: a portable core over `fb.h` plus a swappable **theme**
vtable (palette + metrics + chrome painters, per-painter NULL-fallback).
~20 widgets including menu bar, tabs, slider, spinner, dropdown, and a
multi-line text editor; depth-aware (1/4/8/full-bit via `ui_shade`
ordered dither). Eight themes ship (unodos, macos7, macplus [1-bit],
win31, amiga, c64, apple2, next), host-verified into `themes.png`.
Interaction is a pure function of an abstract `unoui_event` stream
(drag + z-order, focus/Tab, scrollbar/slider thumbs, menus, multi-line
text editing), so a port writes only a small event adapter + `fb`
present; verified into the scripted `storyboard.png`. Distinct from the
kernel-native asm widget set (the "Widgets / dialogs / clipboard" row
above): unoui is the C-side library, not compiled into the asm kernel.
Not yet wired into the port glue `main()`s.
