# UnoDOS/Genesis — port plan (approved 2026-06-11; M0+M1 shipped)

Target: Sega Mega Drive / Genesis — 68000 @ 7.67 MHz (same CPU family as
the Amiga/Mac ports), VDP tile/sprite graphics, 64 KB work RAM, Z80 +
PSG/FM audio, two DE-9 control ports.

## Input: PS/2 keyboard + mouse on the two control ports

The Genesis has no keyboard, so per the plan we read **PS/2 devices
directly through the gameports**, bit-banged by the 68000. The I/O
controller exposes every port pin (D0–D3, TL, TR, TH) as programmable
I/O via the `$A10003/05` data and `$A10009/0B` control registers, and
**port 2's TH line can raise the level-2 EXT interrupt** — which is the
basis of the community-precedent wiring (HardWareMan on SpritesMind
attached a standard PS/2 keyboard "to MD via joystick port #2 (using
#EXT interrupt!)"; Sik's documentation of the official Sega/XBAND
keyboard protocol confirms port 2 + TH/TR handshaking as the keyboard
port convention).

Pin assignment (both ports wired identically; passive adapter — PS/2
devices have internal pull-ups, the MD inputs are pulled up too):

| DE-9 pin | MD signal | PS/2 signal | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | D0 ("Up") | **DATA** | bidirectional (host commands need OC emulation: drive low / float high via the CTRL register) |
| 5 | +5V | +5V | the port supplies power |
| 7 | TH | **CLOCK** | port 2: EXT/HL interrupt on transition → interrupt-driven keyboard; port 1: polled |
| 8 | GND | GND | |

- **Port 2 = keyboard**: CLK on TH gives an interrupt per PS/2 clock
  edge; the level-2 handler shifts in the 11-bit frames (start, 8 data,
  parity, stop) and feeds scancodes to the UnoDOS event queue with the
  PORT-SPEC focus stamp.
- **Port 1 = mouse**: TH on port 1 cannot interrupt, so the driver uses
  the PS/2 **host-inhibit** feature: hold CLK low except during a
  per-frame (vblank) window, then busy-clock pending bytes in. Stream
  mode at 40–100 samples/s decimates cleanly to a 50/60 Hz desktop.
- Fallback: the same driver structure can speak Sik's documented Sega
  keyboard protocol (4-bit bus) later, for XBAND/MegaNet-style hardware.

## Milestone 0 — boot PoC (DONE, verified in BlastEm 2026-06-11)

Boot PoC: vector table + Sega header, TMSS handshake, Z80 quiesce, VDP
init, the shared UnoDOS 8×8 font as 4bpp tiles, UnoDOS palette in CRAM,
splash + PS/2 wiring banner. Superseded by `genesis/kernel.asm` (M1);
the original `genesis/boot.asm` lives in git history. Bring-up trap
for the record: the M0 vector table was off by two entries (22 err
vectors are needed between the reset PC and the spurious-interrupt
vector) — harmless until M1 enabled interrupts, then the first vblank
jumped into the error loop.

## Milestone 1 — desktop, input, Notepad + Music (DONE 2026-06-11)

`genesis/kernel.asm` + `softkbd.i` + `ps2.i` + `apps.i`, 64 KB ROM,
verified in BlastEm 0.6.2 (`genesis/README.md` has the build/test
matrix and the verified-behavior list):

- **Kernel core on VDP** (was roadmap item 2): cell-based drawing
  primitives on plane A (40×28 cells, H40), 4 palette lines = the 4 UI
  attribute schemes from the theme colors, vblank tick + event queue +
  press-time click latch per PORT-SPEC §3/§6, hardware-sprite cursor,
  desktop with the real x86 app icons, window manager with drag /
  raise / close / z-order (windows snap to the 8 px cell grid).
- **Pad-as-mouse** (roadmap item 3, reshaped per direction): d-pad
  moves the cursor with held-time acceleration (Z = turbo), A = click,
  B = soft keyboard, C/Start/X/Y = Enter/Esc/Backspace/Space. Works on
  3-button pads (no X/Y/Z extras).
- **Soft keyboard**: kernel overlay on the bottom 6 cell rows — full
  QWERTY + sticky Shift + F1 + arrows + Esc, hover highlight, posts
  through the shared event queue with the Amiga-port raw codes.
- **PS/2 drivers wired** (real-hardware-only): port 2 keyboard on the
  EXT level-2 interrupt (11-bit frame assembler + scancode set 2
  decode incl. shift/break/E0), port 1 mouse via host-inhibit with a
  per-vblank receive window + boot-time `$F4` probe (no ACK → pad
  mode). The protocol engines are injectable pure routines; the
  AUTOTEST_PS2 build verifies the full decode path in the emulator.
- **Apps**: SysInfo, Clock, Notepad (2 KB buffer, caret, line nav with
  goal column, vertical scroll clamp, status bar), Music (PSG ch-0
  square-wave sequencer, the shared Canon in D arrangement at 60 Hz,
  staff view with live note highlight).

Port-specific traps for the next milestones: acknowledge the vblank
interrupt with a VDP status read (control-port writes must stay single
`move.l`s so the read can't split one); `lsl.w #7` of a negative cell
row flips the control word's top bits into a CRAM write — the
PROBE_GUARD build traps out-of-range cell coordinates and renders the
caller PC in hex; BlastEm's debugger doesn't engage on piped stdin, so
on-screen hex forensics is the workable equivalent.

## Remaining roadmap

1. **M2 — games + sound**: Dostris/OutLast/Pac-Man (tile rendering
   fits them perfectly), PSG square-wave sequencer for the shared game
   songs (FM later), Tracker over PSG's 3 tones + noise.
2. **M3 — Theme + Files**: Theme app over CRAM (the 8 shared presets
   restyle all four palette lines), Files over a ROM-disk.
3. **M4 — storage**: SRAM-backed saves (battery-backed cartridge RAM
   at `$200000`, header declaration, emulator + flashcart friendly);
   unlocks Notepad F1-save.
4. **M5 — scheduler**: port the Amiga milestone-3 cooperative
   scheduler (plain 68000; the stack arena and tick source change).
5. **Real hardware**: PS/2 wiring validation (keyboard EXT interrupt,
   mouse inhibit/poll timing), TMSS on a model 3, pad feel, PSG
   balance. This is the first new port headed for physical hardware.

Notes/risks: work RAM is 64 KB total (the app model fits; Notepad runs
a 2 KB buffer), and PS/2-over-gameport needs the real-hardware pass —
emulators don't model PS/2 devices on the control ports.
