# UnoDOS Roadmap

## Post-Audit Backlog (2026-06) — COMPLETE as of v3.26.0 / Build 405
All items from docs/AUDIT-HANDOFF-2026-06.md §5 are done:
- [x] 8088 compatibility pass — kernel + all apps + floppy boot chain
      assemble under `cpu 8086`; FAT16/IDE region is `cpu 386`-bracketed
      and runtime-gated in fat16_mount; HD boot chain stays 386+ by design
- [x] Cursor hide/lock race fix (cursor_protect_begin, 36 sites)
- [x] Performance wave (cga_pixel_calc row LUT, cursor sprite byte-XOR
      fast path, floppy multi-sector reads, stosw fills, dispatcher
      movzx/bt removal)
- [x] Confirmed-but-unfixed findings (app_load size validation, file-handle
      reaping on task kill, press-time key/click routing, EVENT_MOUSE
      edge-only + focus routing, deferred IRQ12 cursor, 360KB make target,
      FAT16 AH=41h probe, XT KBC gate, SysInfo uptime, Notepad status bar,
      drag clamping, body click-to-raise)
- [x] Dynamic QEMU regression scenarios re-run green against Build 405

### Remaining 8088 follow-ups
- [ ] Real-hardware validation on an 8088 (86Box/PCem or physical XT) —
      QEMU cannot emulate an 8088; current builds are assembler-verified
      (`cpu 8086`) and QEMU-behavior-verified only
- [ ] draw_char CGA row-blit fast path (audit digest "Stage 2", ~10x text
      speedup on real 8088 hardware; Stage 1 MUL removal is done)
- [ ] Launcher select_icon draws over open windows (z-order violation,
      cosmetic — known audit finding, low priority)
- [ ] Background window content not repainted until raised (single-topmost
      clipping model; visible when a covered window is exposed by a drag)

## Kernel / Window Manager
- [ ] Modal window flag (WIN_FLAG_MODAL) — block focus changes when modal is active
- [ ] Window minimize/maximize
- [ ] Preemptive multitasking / threading
- [ ] Serial mouse support
- [ ] Animated sprite support (multi-frame sprite API)

## New Apps
- [ ] Calculator
- [ ] Paint / drawing tool
- [ ] Simple game (Minesweeper, Snake, etc.)

## App Improvements
- [ ] Notepad: Find/Replace
- [ ] Notepad: Save As uses system file dialog
- [ ] File Manager: create new file / new folder
- [ ] Dostris: performance improvements for 386+
- [ ] Music: animated note playback (stems, beams, note duration visuals)

## File Dialog
- [ ] File type filter (e.g. show only .TXT)
- [ ] Show file sizes in list

## Filesystem
- [ ] Directory support (create, navigate subdirectories)
- [ ] Long filename support (LFN)

## Boot / Hardware
- [ ] 8086-compatible boot for HP 200LX, Sharp PC-3100 (kernel itself is
      now 8086-clean; needs 720KB media/geometry support — see audit digest
      ~line 4552 for the design notes)

## APIs
- [ ] Multi-byte-wide sprite support (>8px width)
- [ ] 2bpp color sprite API (like icons but variable size)
- [ ] Update API_REFERENCE.md for APIs 91-104 (and API 28's new
      SI/DI/AH/AL press-latch returns, API 63 ticks-since-boot)

## Documentation
- [ ] App development tutorial / sample app walkthrough
- [ ] Screenshots for README
