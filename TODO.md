# UnoDOS Roadmap

## Post-Audit Backlog (2026-06) — COMPLETE as of v3.26.0 / Build 405
All items from docs/AUDIT-HANDOFF-2026-06.md §5 are done:
- [x] 8088 compatibility pass — kernel + all apps + floppy boot chain
      assemble under `cpu 8086`; FAT16/IDE region is `cpu 386`-bracketed
      and runtime-gated in fat16_mount; HD boot chain stays 386+ by design
- [x] Cursor hide/lock race fix (cursor_protect_begin, 36 sites)
- [x] Performance wave (cga_pixel_calc row LUT, cursor sprite byte-XOR
      fast path, floppy multi-sector reads, stosw fills, dispatcher
      movzx/bt removal)
- [x] Confirmed-but-unfixed findings (app_load size validation, file-handle
      reaping on task kill, press-time key/click routing, EVENT_MOUSE
      edge-only + focus routing, deferred IRQ12 cursor, 360KB make target,
      FAT16 AH=41h probe, XT KBC gate, SysInfo uptime, Notepad status bar,
      drag clamping, body click-to-raise)
- [x] Dynamic QEMU regression scenarios re-run green against Build 405

### Known issue (2026-06-12): root-dir entries past 16 break app launch
The low-res launcher has 16 icon slots (MAX_ICONS_LO) and the LAST one
is its own Refresh icon - so only 15 apps fit. App #16+ collides with
the refresh slot: blank icon, launch becomes a disk rescan (or fails).
Repro: add a 16th .BIN to the floppy144 list and Enter-launch the last
icons. Fix direction: exclude the refresh slot from MAX_ICONS_LO math
or page the icon grid. Workaround shipped: MOUSE.BIN and MKBOOT.BIN
(diagnostic/utility) left off the default image so Tracker + Paint fit
in the 15-app envelope; both still build via 'make apps'.

### Remaining 8088 follow-ups
- [ ] Real-hardware validation on an 8088 (86Box/PCem or physical XT) —
      QEMU cannot emulate an 8088; current builds are assembler-verified
      (`cpu 8086`) and QEMU-behavior-verified only
- [ ] draw_char CGA row-blit fast path (audit digest "Stage 2", ~10x text
      speedup on real 8088 hardware; Stage 1 MUL removal is done)
- [ ] Launcher select_icon draws over open windows (z-order violation,
      cosmetic — known audit finding, low priority)
- [ ] Background window content not repainted until raised (single-topmost
      clipping model; visible when a covered window is exposed by a drag)

## Platform Ports (68K) — milestone 2 shipped 2026-06-11
Done: Amiga (bare-metal, amiga/) + Mac System 7 color + Mac System 1-6
mono (Toolbox-based, mac/) all boot to the desktop with the WM and run
SysInfo, Clock, Files, Notepad, Music. Spec: docs/PORT-SPEC.md.

Next steps:
- [x] Amiga: MFM track reader + portable FAT12 core, READ path
      (fdd.i + fat12.i): DF1 trackdisk DMA + Amiga-MFM sector decode
      with track cache; FAT12 mount/root-dir/chain-walk; Files mounts
      the DF1 data disk ('m') and opens files in Notepad. mkfat.py
      builds the 880KB FAT12 data image (PC interchange via mtools).
      Verified in WinUAE: multi-cluster CHAIN.TXT read end-to-end.
- [x] Amiga FAT12 WRITE path: MFM track encoder (sector headers,
      checksums, clock-fixup), one-revolution track writes with
      write-protect gate, track-granular RMW sector writes; FAT
      alloc/free/flush, root-dir create/overwrite. Notepad F1 saves to
      DF1 (FAT files + new UNTITLEDTXT), Tracker s/l persists the song.
      Verified in WinUAE: byte-exact image deltas + on-screen re-read.
- [ ] FAT12 polish: delete, rename, free-space display, dir-full UX,
      Tracker .MOD-format export, write-verify pass
- [x] Amiga: Notepad up/down line navigation (goal-column memory) +
      vertical scroll (caret-follow clamp) — verified in WinUAE via the
      AUTOTEST_NOTEPAD build
- [ ] Amiga: blitter fast paths (text row-blit, fills) — the big OCS win
- [ ] Amiga: TICKS_SEC calibration (vblank pacing runs fast under the
      WinUAE test config) + NTSC detection
- [x] Mac: Files subdirectory navigation (PBGetCatInfo ioDrDirID walk,
      PBHSetVol current dir, ".." parent entry) — verified under Executor
      via the UnoDOS7FTest build (enter dir, "..", open file in subdir)
- [ ] Mac: offscreen GWorld double-buffering for flicker-free repaints
- [ ] Both: audio ear-check on real hardware / sound-enabled emulator
      (sequencers are register-verified; test configs run sound off)
- [x] Amiga: MILESTONE 3 cooperative scheduler (scheduler.i): every
      window runs its app proc in its own task with a private 2KB
      stack; task_yield context switch, per-task event mailboxes,
      keys + frame ticks posted by the kernel task, spawn/kill tied
      to window create/close. Verified in WinUAE: game gravity and
      the FAT12 write flow both run through the task machinery.
- [x] Mac: milestone 3 scheduler (2026-06-12): per-window cooperative
      tasks in unodos.c - 68K asm context switch (movem + SP swap),
      heap stacks, one-slot mailboxes with key yield-retry, StkLowPt
      cleared per the Thread Manager convention; both targets
- [x] Mac Tracker (2026-06-12): the 32x4 pattern editor on up to four
      Sound Manager square channels, byte-identical pattern format,
      SONG.TRK via the File Manager
- [x] Mac PC floppy (2026-06-12): FAT12 R/W core in C over an
      injectable block device (.Sony raw driver on SuperDrives; RAM
      image under Executor); Files 'v' volume toggle, Notepad
      round-trip; PC-interchange verified byte-for-byte by an
      independent parser (mac/test_fat12.py)
- [x] Paint on ALL FIVE targets (2026-06-12): the MacPaint-style
      editor (pencil/brush/eraser/line/rect/frect/oval/foval/flood/
      spray) with platform-gamut color selectors - 256 8-bit colors
      on Mac 7, 1-bit dither patterns on Classic, 4096 via copper
      pens on Amiga, 512 via CRAM line-3 tuning on Genesis, full
      mode palette on x86 incl. the 256-color VGA picker
- [x] x86 Tracker + Paint (2026-06-12): apps/tracker.asm (PC speaker,
      leftmost-voice playback, shared SONG.TRK format - QEMU-verified
      with the demo song playing) and apps/paint.asm (QEMU-verified:
      drag strokes, filled shapes, spray, CGA all-colors picker)
- [x] Window click routing fix (2026-06-12): find_window_at returned
      hits with stale flags on Genesis AND Amiga - every window click
      fell through to the desktop (found on real Genesis hardware;
      AUTOTEST_CLICK now guards it by closing a window's close box)
- [ ] Real-hardware smoke tests (A500; Mac Plus + Mac II-class)
- [ ] Mac: Executor visual pass for the milestone-3 features (blocked
      on a capture path; a Windows-native Executor build would let the
      automated rig drive it like BlastEm/WinUAE)

## Genesis Port (2026-06-12) - MILESTONES 1-6 DONE (Amiga parity)
- [x] M0 boot PoC (TMSS, VDP init, font tiles, splash) — verified in
      BlastEm
- [x] M1 kernel: cell-based desktop on plane A (40x28, H40), WM with
      drag/raise/close/z-order, event queue + click latch, sprite
      cursor, icons from the x86 .BIN art (genesis/kernel.asm)
- [x] M1 input: 6-button pad as mouse (d-pad accel + Z turbo, A=click,
      B=soft kbd, C/Start/X/Y synth keys; 3-button safe) + full soft
      keyboard overlay (QWERTY, sticky Shift, F1, arrows)
- [x] M1 PS/2 drivers wired for real hardware: port 2 kbd on the EXT
      interrupt (set-2 decode), port 1 mouse via host-inhibit vblank
      windows + boot probe; decode paths emulator-verified via
      synthetic streams (AUTOTEST_PS2)
- [x] M1 apps: SysInfo, Clock, Notepad (caret/line-nav/scroll/status),
      Music (PSG ch0 Canon in D, staff view)
- [x] M2 game ports (2026-06-11): Dostris + OutLast + Pac-Man, same
      tables/physics/AI as x86, cell rendering via the gcol map
      (Amiga $0RGB -> Genesis $0BGR!), Pac-Man actors as hardware
      sprites, Korobeiniki/Sunset Drive on PSG ch1, game-mode pad
      (d-pad = arrows w/ hold-repeat, A=Space, X=new, Y=pause);
      verified in BlastEm (dostris/outlast/pacman AUTOTESTs)
- [x] M4 SRAM storage (2026-06-11): 8KB battery SRAM + USV1 mini-FS
      (8 files, overwrite-by-name, delete-compaction), Files app,
      Notepad F1-save; BlastEm-verified round trip. $A130F1 once at
      boot only (toggling unmaps it in BlastEm).
- [x] M4.5 tape/WAV storage (2026-06-11): KCS 1200-baud AFSK, PSG
      write path (record the headphone jack), comparator-on-port-2
      read path, injectable decoder (AUTOTEST_TAPE), mktape.py
      WAV encode/decode round trip; Files w/r keys. Comparator
      hardware = real-hw checklist.
- [x] M3 (2026-06-12): Theme over CRAM (8 shared presets + 3-bit RGB
      custom editing, themed entries rewritten live) and Tracker over
      PSG (3 square channels + noise, byte-identical pattern format
      to the Amiga tracker, demo song, edit preview, s/l to SRAM and
      t/y to tape) — BlastEm-verified (AUTOTEST_THEME/_TRACKER)
- [x] M5 (2026-06-12): Sega CD backup RAM via Mode-1 (genesis/bram.i):
      expansion probe (DISK bit + bus-error recovery — BlastEm raises
      a bus error on $400000 with no CD), Kosinski sub-BIOS
      decompress + Sub-CPU boot, ~300-byte SP stub calling the BIOS
      _BURAM traps, LIST/READ/WRITE/DELETE mailbox RPC with Word-RAM
      staging, Files volume toggle ('v') + Notepad F1 to the active
      volume, names normalized 8.3 -> 11 chars with the original name
      in the payload header. RPC/UI emulator-verified through the
      injectable fake transport (AUTOTEST_BRAM); the BIOS-trap path
      itself is a CD-emulator/real-hardware item
- [x] M6 (2026-06-12): cooperative scheduler (genesis/scheduler.i,
      port of amiga/scheduler.i): per-window tasks with private 2KB
      stacks, one-slot mailboxes (keys yield-retry so bursts survive),
      kernel task 0 pumps input/audio; BlastEm-verified (soft-kbd
      typing, PS/2, game gravity all through the task machinery)
- [ ] BRAM follow-ups: verify the Mode-1 BIOS path under Genesis Plus
      GX / Ares (BlastEm has no CD), listing >8 files (BRMDIR paging),
      Tracker save-to-BRAM
- [ ] Deferred: SD card over bit-banged SPI + FAT16 (spec:
      docs/GENESIS-STORAGE.md; lands with the adapter PCB)
- [x] Real hardware (2026-06-12): the cartridge boots and runs on a
      physical console — first new port validated on metal
- [ ] Real-hardware adapters still to exercise: PS/2 wiring, tape
      comparator, Sega CD Mode-1 end-to-end

## Game Ports (2026-06-11) - DONE
- [x] Dostris on Amiga + Mac (same piece tables/scoring/speed curve as
      apps/dostris.asm; windowed; verified WinUAE + Executor)
- [x] OutLast on Amiga + Mac (same track/perspective/traffic/physics as
      apps/outlast.asm; verified WinUAE + Executor)
- [x] Game music on the 68K ports (Korobeiniki + Sunset Drive; Paula + Sound Manager sequencers)
- [x] Pac-Man on the 68K ports (full maze + 3-ghost AI on both;
      Amiga uses incremental tile rendering; verified WinUAE + Executor)

## Tracker (2026-06-11) - v1 DONE
- [x] Amiga Tracker app: write + play 4-channel Paula music (MOD-style
      ProTracker periods, 32-row pattern editor, 4 chip-synthesized
      instruments, demo song, edit preview)
- [ ] Tracker: load/save real .MOD files (needs FAT12), more patterns,
      volume/effect columns, sample import

## Color/Resolution Upgrade (2026-06-11) - DONE
- [x] Amiga: 5 bitplanes / 32 colors (OCS lowres max); themed UI colors
      0-3 + fixed extended game palette 4-31; per-plane primitives
- [x] Mac color targets: true-RGB game art (8-bit QuickDraw), larger
      playfields (Dostris 16px cells, OutLast 480x300 at 3/2 scale)
- [ ] Amiga 640-wide OCS hires option (16 colors max; needs WM-wide
      content scaling per PORT-SPEC)

## Theming & Splash (2026-06-11) - DONE
- [x] 8 shared preset palettes on every color-capable platform (x86 VGA
      via new kernel API 105 + Settings buttons; Amiga Theme app via
      copper; Mac Theme app via mutable kPalette). Preset 1 = Classic
      VGA. Custom colors: per-channel RGB editing on Amiga + Mac;
      element-color mapping (existing) on x86 CGA.
- [x] Per-platform boot splash stating "UnoDOS 3" with platform art:
      IBM PC (CRT/unit/keyboard) on x86, striped checkmark on Amiga,
      happy compact Mac on the Mac targets.

## Kernel / Window Manager
- [ ] Modal window flag (WIN_FLAG_MODAL) — block focus changes when modal is active
- [ ] Window minimize/maximize
- [ ] Preemptive multitasking / threading
- [ ] Serial mouse support
- [ ] Animated sprite support (multi-frame sprite API)

## New Apps
- [ ] Calculator
- [ ] Paint / drawing tool
- [ ] Simple game (Minesweeper, Snake, etc.)

## App Improvements
- [ ] Notepad: Find/Replace
- [ ] Notepad: Save As uses system file dialog
- [ ] File Manager: create new file / new folder
- [ ] Dostris: performance improvements for 386+
- [ ] Music: animated note playback (stems, beams, note duration visuals)

## File Dialog
- [ ] File type filter (e.g. show only .TXT)
- [ ] Show file sizes in list

## Filesystem
- [ ] Directory support (create, navigate subdirectories)
- [ ] Long filename support (LFN)

## Boot / Hardware
- [ ] 8086-compatible boot for HP 200LX, Sharp PC-3100 (kernel itself is
      now 8086-clean; needs 720KB media/geometry support — see audit digest
      ~line 4552 for the design notes)

## APIs
- [ ] Multi-byte-wide sprite support (>8px width)
- [ ] 2bpp color sprite API (like icons but variable size)
- [ ] Update API_REFERENCE.md for APIs 91-104 (and API 28's new
      SI/DI/AH/AL press-latch returns, API 63 ticks-since-boot)

## Documentation
- [ ] App development tutorial / sample app walkthrough
- [ ] Screenshots for README

## MacPlus standalone OS port (macplus/, after M1 2026-06-12)
- [ ] M2: UnoDOS floppy filesystem (shared layout with the x86 port) +
      disk-loaded app binaries via the .Sony BIOS layer; Files/Notepad
- [ ] M3+: sound (Plus pulse-width buffer), Theme-as-dither-schemes,
      Tracker, games, scheduler, Paint — Amiga parity
- [ ] Real-hardware / Mini vMac validation (needs a user-supplied Mac
      Plus ROM dump at macplus/vMac.ROM). Calibration points: mouse
      quadrature polarity (flip eor sense in isr_lvl2 if an axis is
      reversed), keyboard Instant-poll cadence, SCC write-recovery
      delays (nops may need widening on real silicon)
- [ ] Harness: SE/Classic variants (screen base differences), bus-error
      injection to exercise the kernel fault screens
