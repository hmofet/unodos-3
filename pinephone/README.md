# UnoDOS / PinePhone (Allwinner A64, AArch64)

The **tenth** fresh contract-driven port — and the **second AArch64 world**. It
**reuses the Raspberry Pi AArch64 core** (the same GNU-as/GAS dialect, the same
software-framebuffer primitives, the same Dostris and app logic), retargeted to the
**Allwinner A64** SoC (4× Cortex-A53) and a **portrait** phone panel (480×640).
MINIMAL profile (CONTRACT-ARCH §9): a 4-column icon launcher, one full-screen app
at a time, directional nav.

Two things differ from the Pi, both honest to the silicon:

- **Display.** The A64 has no GPU mailbox. Exactly as the Pi relies on the VideoCore
  firmware to bring up HDMI, this port assumes the boot chain (boot ROM → SPL →
  U-Boot) has already initialised DRAM and the panel clock path (TCON0 + MIPI-DSI +
  the panel), then programs the **Display Engine 2.0 (DE2)** mixer **UI layer** to
  scan out our XRGB8888 framebuffer in DRAM (`PINE_FB = 0x40400000`).
- **Timing.** Per-frame pacing reads the **ARM architectural generic timer**
  (`cntpct_el0`) directly via `mrs` — no MMIO at all, real-hardware-correct.

## Status — M1 · M2 · M3 all shipped ✅

Verified headlessly on a **Unicorn Cortex-A core** (`pinephone/harness.py`) running
the real payload. Because the kernel uses a fixed DRAM framebuffer and the generic
timer (which Unicorn advances on its own), the harness is even simpler than the Pi's:
it maps DRAM + a RAM sink over the DE2 register block, runs the budget so the
AUTOTEST pad plays out, and renders the DE2 framebuffer to a PNG. Nothing is faked
(`pinephone/shots/*.png`):

- **M1 — launcher** (`shots/m1_boot.png`): boot → DE2 UI-layer scanout → the
  inverted "UnoDOS 3 – PinePhone (Allwinner A64)" title bar and a 4-column, 11-icon
  colour grid, in portrait.
- **M2 — navigation** (`shots/m2_nav.png`): a generic-timer-paced loop, a d-pad
  selection highlight (the selected label inverts), **A** launches / **B** returns.
- **M3 — apps** (`shots/m3_*.png`): SysInfo, live **Clock** (HH:MM:SS), Notepad,
  Files, **Theme** (cycles the 32-bit palette), **Music** (UI + note timeline), and
  **Dostris** — the falling-blocks game in a centred portrait well.

> **Real input + audio.** The interactive (non-AUTOTEST) build reads a real
> **A64 UART0 serial console** (16550, on the headphone jack): `WASD` = d-pad,
> `Enter`/`Space` = A, `Backspace` = B. The harness emulates the 16550 RX, so this
> path is verified end-to-end (`shots/live_nav.png`, `shots/live_notepad.png` —
> navigation + app launch from injected serial input). The capacitive touch panel is
> a heavier future driver. The AC200 audio codec (a large I2S/AIF effort, unlike the
> Pi's simple PWM jack) is also future. Everything emulator-verifiable is verified.

## Hardware brought up

| Part | Detail |
|---|---|
| CPU | **Allwinner A64** — 4× ARM Cortex-A53 (**AArch64**); secondary cores parked via `mpidr_el1` |
| Video | **Display Engine 2.0** mixer 0 UI layer (`0x01100000`): global enable + size, blender pipe, UI layer attribute (XRGB8888), pitch, top address = `PINE_FB`; assumes SPL brought up TCON0/MIPI-DSI |
| Surface | 480×640 **portrait**, 32bpp XRGB8888 linear framebuffer in DRAM at `0x40400000` |
| Colour | 16-entry 32-bit palette in RAM; pixels store the looked-up XRGB word |
| Timing | ARM generic timer `cntpct_el0` (24 MHz) via `mrs`; `wait_vblank` busy-waits one `FRAME_TICKS` (~60 Hz) |
| Audio | UI/timeline only; the AC200 codec path is a future driver |
| Input | **A64 UART0** serial console (`0x01C28000`, 16550); poll `LSR.DR`, read `RBR`; WASD+Enter+Backspace → pad (touch panel = future) |
| RAM | DRAM at `0x40000000`: payload `0x40080000`, stack `→0x40200000`, vars `0x40300000`, fb info `0x40320000`, framebuffer `0x40400000` |
| Boot | flat AArch64 payload at `0x40080000` (the U-Boot `kernel_addr_r`); `_start` parks cores, sets SP, programs DE2 |

## Build & run

```sh
sh pinephone/build.sh                                   # -> pinephone/build/unodos.bin
sh pinephone/build.sh nav|app|clock|theme|music|dostris  # AUTOTEST builds
python pinephone/harness.py pinephone/build/unodos.bin pinephone/shots/m1_boot.png
```

Toolchain: `aarch64-linux-gnu-{as,ld,objcopy}` (binutils 2.42, via WSL) + `python`
with `unicorn` 2.x. On real hardware: load `unodos.bin` at `0x40080000` from
U-Boot (`go 0x40080000`) after the panel is up.

## Contract

Screen geometry comes from **unogen** (`[world.pinephone]` →
`unodef/gen/pinephone/sys_gen.inc`, the `aarch64` GAS dialect). The Allwinner DE2
display path and the portrait orientation are the port's own; the cell geometry is
the genuine Contract overlap. The AArch64 core is shared with [the Raspberry Pi
port](../rpi/README.md).
