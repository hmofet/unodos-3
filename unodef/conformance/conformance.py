"""UnoDOS conformance — PORT-SPEC §6 made executable (CONTRACT-ARCH Phase 2 / §15.2).

Host-only, stdlib-only. Two layers:

  A. STRUCTURAL conformance — static invariants checked against the Contract, the
     generated x86 surface, and kernel.asm (audit-tax rules 8, 9, 10-structure).

  B. BEHAVIORAL conformance — the §6 policy invariants (z-order, event focus/stale,
     the fixed-size tombstone queue, edge-only mouse, owner-based reaping) as
     EXECUTABLE REFERENCE MODELS + golden vectors. Each invariant is paired with the
     HISTORICAL BUGGY behavior PORT-SPEC warns about; the runner asserts the
     reference passes every vector AND the buggy version fails at least one — proving
     the vectors discriminate (they are not vacuous).

These reference models are the host oracle every world's implementation will later be
run against (§15.1). Run:  python unodef/conformance/conformance.py
Exit code 0 = all conformant.
