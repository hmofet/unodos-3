# UnoDOS/SNES — standalone OS for the 65816 Super Nintendo (milestone 1)

Like the other bare-metal UnoDOS ports, this is **a real operating
system**, not a game running on someone else's OS. The console powers on,
the CPU reset vector jumps straight into UnoDOS, and from the first
instruction UnoDOS owns the machine — its own PPU setup, its own tilemap
renderer, its own vblank interrupt handler, its own input. There is no
BIOS, no monitor, nothing else on the cartridge.

This port is the **Genesis port's twin** re-expressed in 65816: a
cell-based desktop composed on background tiles, a hardware-sprite cursor,
pad-as-pointer + soft keyboard, and a battery-SRAM mini-FS. The 65816
toolchain (cc65) is the one the Apple IIGS port introduces and the SNES
shares. See [HANDOFF.md](HANDOFF.md) for the full M0–M3 plan.

## Status

**M0 — DONE.** A LoROM `.sfc` boots in Mesen2 to the "UnoDOS 3" tile
splash and reacts to the joypad. Foundation end to end: cartridge header +
vectors, native-mode bring-up, the shared font as SNES tiles, the palette,
the **shadow + DMA** render architecture, the vblank NMI, auto-joypad input.

**M1 — DONE.** A tile desktop with a window manager, a hardware-sprite
cursor, pad-as-pointer + a soft keyboard, and the SysInfo + Clock apps. The
Genesis M1 surface re-expressed in 65816 on the shadow+DMA model. Verified
in Mesen2 (the F12 framebuffer screenshot, below): menu bar, two overlapping
windows (correct z-order, chrome, palettes), a live advancing clock, and the
full cyan soft keyboard.

![M1 desktop](build/m1.png)

- **Cell renderer** — `fill_cells`/`draw_str`/`draw_char` write the tilemap
  shadow; four UI attribute schemes = Mode-1 palette lines 0-3
  (NORM/INV/ACC/KEY), so the same font + solid tiles serve every scheme.
- **Window manager** — z-order list, raise/close, title-bar drag (cell
  snapping, clamped), close box, window chrome (edges + corners).
- **Input** — pad-as-pointer from the auto-joypad word: d-pad moves the
  cursor (held-time acceleration, L/R = turbo), A = click/drag, B = soft
  keyboard, Y = Enter, X = Backspace, Start = Esc, Select = Space. Press
  edges are latched in the NMI; the main loop posts them as `EV_KEY`s with
  the Amiga/Genesis raw codes, so app key handlers stay byte-portable.
- **Soft keyboard** — `softkbd.inc`, re-laid-out for 32 cells (Genesis is
  40): layout table, hit-test, sticky shift, hover highlight.
- **Cursor** — two 8x8 OAM sprites (the shared arrow), positioned from the
  mouse in the NMI and DMA'd to OAM each vblank.
- **Apps** — SysInfo (CPU/RAM/region/input) and Clock (a real 60 Hz NMI
  tick → HH:MM:SS), the topmost window refreshed once a second.
- **NMI direct page** — the vblank handler runs on direct page `$0100` so
  its scratch never collides with the main loop's (`$0000`).

**M2 — storage core done (games remaining).** The USV1 SRAM mini-FS
([sram.inc](sram.inc)) plus Notepad + Files ([apps.inc](apps.inc)). 8 KB of
LoROM cartridge SRAM at `$70:0000` (byte-addressable — none of the Genesis
odd-lane `*2`); init/save/read/find/delete with heap compaction. Notepad is
an append-style editor (type via soft keyboard / pad, F1 saves to SRAM);
Files lists the directory, opens into Notepad, deletes. The desktop now has
four icons (SysInfo/Clock/Notepad/Files).

![M2 storage](build/m2.png)

Verified in Mesen2: the scene seeds a 44-byte note, saves DEMO.TXT, and the
Files window lists it at the right size — the save → directory → listing
round-trip. (Deviation: append-style Notepad, not full caret nav yet.) The
M2 games (Dostris/Pac-Man/OutLast) and all of M3 (SPC700 audio + Tracker/
Music + Theme + scheduler) remain — see [HANDOFF.md](HANDOFF.md).

## The envelope (and its deviations)

- **65C816 @ 3.58 MHz**, 128 KB WRAM at `$7E:0000–$7F:FFFF`. The low 8 KB
  (`$7E:0000–$1FFF`) is mirrored into `$00:0000–$1FFF` of every bank — the
  65816 stack and direct page must live in bank 0, so the kernel keeps its
  state and the tilemap shadow there (`VARS = $0100`, `TMAP = $1000`),
  reachable both as bank-0 mirrors from the CPU and as real WRAM `$7E` from
  DMA.
- **Tile/sprite PPU, no bitmap mode** (same as Genesis). **Mode 1**: BG1 is
  the desktop plane (16-colour 4bpp tiles). The visible field is
  **256×224 ⇒ 32×28 cells** of 8 px. Genesis is 40×28; **this port's
  windows are narrower by 8 columns** — the documented deviation, the way
  macplus documents 512×342.
- **VRAM/CGRAM/OAM are write-only outside vblank or forced blank.** This is
  the one architectural inversion vs. Genesis (which writes its VDP from
  the main loop). See *The rendering rule* below.
- **Storage:** battery SRAM on the cartridge (M2). Declared as 0 KB at M0
  (ROM-only header) — SRAM arrives with the USV1 mini-FS.
- **Audio:** the SPC700 coprocessor with its own RAM + DSP, fed by an
  uploaded driver (M3).

## The rendering rule (decided at M0, HANDOFF §2)

The Genesis law was "all VDP access in the main loop; ISRs only set
state." The SNES **inverts the transfer half** because the PPU is only
writable during blank, so UnoDOS/SNES adopts this split from line one:

- The **main loop** (and later all app/WM code) renders into a **WRAM
  tilemap shadow** (32×32 words at `$7E:1000`) and sets a dirty flag. It
  never touches the PPU.
- The **NMI handler** (vblank) does the transfers and input: it DMAs the
  shadow to VRAM when dirty, acks the NMI, waits out the auto-joypad read
  and latches `JOY1` into the vars block, and counts the frame tick. No
  app/WM logic runs in the ISR (PORT-SPEC §6 rule 2) — it only moves
  prepared bytes and samples input.
- **Static tiles/palette** (font, chrome, icons) upload once at boot under
  forced blank; dynamic patterns will go through a per-frame DMA budget
  queue at M3.

At M0 the dirty flush rewrites the whole 2 KB tilemap each frame, which
fits comfortably in one vblank; dirty-row flushing is an M1 concern.

## Boot chain

1. Console reset → the 65816 starts in 6502 **emulation mode** and jumps
   through the emulation RESET vector at `$00:FFFC` to `Reset`.
2. `Reset` (kernel.asm): `clc/xce` to **native mode**, `rep #$38` (16-bit
   A/X/Y), stack to `$1FFF`, DB/DP = 0; forces blank (`$2100 = $8F`),
   clears the PPU registers, uploads the tile blob to the BG1 char base and
   the palette to CGRAM via DMA, composes the splash into the shadow and
   flushes it once, configures Mode 1 + BG1, then turns the screen on and
   enables NMI + auto-joypad (`$4200 = $81`).
3. The main loop `wai`s for the NMI, then re-renders the `PAD:xxxx` line
   from the latched joypad word and marks the shadow dirty; the next NMI
   flushes it. Forever.

## Cartridge layout

LoROM, 32 KB, slow ROM. The ld65 config ([lorom.cfg](lorom.cfg)) maps the
ROM to bank `$00` `$8000–$FFFF`, so a `$8000+` address X sits at file
offset `X − $8000` and the header lands at `$7FC0`:

| Addr | Field |
|---|---|
| `$FFC0` | title `UNODOS 3 - SNES PORT ` (21 bytes) |
| `$FFD5` | map mode `$20` (LoROM, slow) |
| `$FFD6` | cartridge type `$00` (ROM only) |
| `$FFD7` | ROM size `$05` (32 KB) |
| `$FFD9` | country `$01` (NTSC) |
| `$FFDC/$FFDE` | checksum complement / checksum (patched by build.sh) |
| `$FFEA` | native NMI vector → `NMI` |
| `$FFFC` | emulation RESET vector → `Reset` |

## Build

```sh
./build.sh           # -> build/unodos.sfc       (interactive: live joypad)
./build.sh test      # -> build/unodos_test.sfc  (AUTOTEST: synthetic input)
```

`build.sh` runs [mkdata.py](mkdata.py) (shared font → `gen_data.inc`),
assembles with `ca65 --cpu 65816`, links with `ld65 -C lorom.cfg`, and
patches the cartridge checksum. Toolchain: cc65 (ca65/ld65 V2.19) at
`C:\Users\arin\snes-tools\bin` — the same suite the IIGS port stands up.

### mkdata.py — the data format

The shared `kernel/font8x8.asm` (95 glyphs, ASCII 32–126, 1 byte/row,
MSB-left) is converted to **SNES 4bpp planar tiles**: 32 bytes per 8×8
tile, eight `(plane0,plane1)` row pairs then eight `(plane2,plane3)` pairs.
Glyphs are fg = palette index 1 on bg = index 2 (an opaque text cell, the
Genesis model). The palette is **BGR555** with entries 0–4 = the UnoDOS UI
colours (PORT-SPEC §1): DOS-blue backdrop/bg, white fg, cyan + magenta
accents.

## Test rig

Mesen2 (`C:\Users\arin\snes-tools\mesen\Mesen.exe`) is the regression
emulator (the BlastEm role).

```powershell
./setup_mesen.ps1                       # ONCE: dismiss the first-run dialog
./run_mesen.ps1 -Rom build\unodos_test.sfc -Out build\m1.png
```

The capture method is the **hard-won** part of this rig:

1. **Capture via Mesen's own F12 screenshot, not a window grab.** On this
   headless/RDP host the emulator's GPU surface comes back *black* through
   `PrintWindow`, and `CopyFromScreen` fails outright. Forcing Mesen's
   *software* renderer makes the window grabbable, but that display blit has
   an artifact (it drops BG palette bits to 0 below ~scanline 160). The fix:
   `run_mesen.ps1` triggers **F12 = TakeScreenshot** (Mesen keycode 101),
   which writes the **accurate PPU framebuffer** to
   `Documents/Mesen2/Screenshots/<rom>_NNN.png`, independent of the display
   path. Focus is forced with `AttachThreadInput` (a plain
   `SetForegroundWindow` loses the foreground race and the keystroke is
   dropped). This is the reference render — proven byte-correct against CPU
   VRAM read-back.
2. **Input is verified by AUTOTEST, not host keystrokes.** Mesen's CLI does
   not autoload a Lua script and its key IDs are awkward to inject, so the
   `test` build self-injects synthetic input in the NMI (the Genesis AUTOTEST
   fallback): M0 flips `PAD 0000 → C0A0`; M1 drives the cursor and stages the
   desktop scene (SysInfo + Clock + soft keyboard). The interactive build
   tracks the real controller.

The vars block carries the magic `"UDM1"` at `$7E:0100` as a discovery
handle for memory asserts.

### Captured M0 evidence

- [build/desktop.png](build/desktop.png) — interactive build, `PAD:0000`.
- [build/autotest.png](build/autotest.png) — AUTOTEST build, `PAD:C0A0`
  with the `* AUTOTEST *` banner (the synthetic-input pipeline).
