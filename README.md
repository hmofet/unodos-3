## Overview

UnoDOS 3 is a GUI-first operating system that boots directly into a windowed desktop environment. It runs on bare metal x86 hardware with no DOS dependency — just BIOS services and an Intel 8088 or later processor. The entire OS, including a ~46KB kernel (loaded from a 104-sector / 52KB reserved area) with 106 system calls, a window manager, two filesystems, cooperative multitasking, and 19 applications, fits on a single 1.44MB floppy disk.

### Philosophy

- **GUI-First**: No command line. The system boots directly into a graphical desktop with draggable icons, windows, and mouse support.
- **Bare Metal**: Runs on raw hardware using only BIOS services. No DOS, no runtime, no dependencies.
- **Vintage-Friendly**: Designed for the constraints of 1980s hardware — runs on an IBM PC/XT-class machine with a CGA card. (Verified on a cycle-accurate 8088: 256KB boots the desktop; 640KB enables the full 5-app multitasking envelope. The kernel itself loads in 128KB but the launcher does not fit below 192KB — see [docs/PORT-8088.md](docs/PORT-8088.md).)
- **Self-Contained**: The kernel, window manager, GUI toolkit, filesystem drivers, and the application set fit on one floppy disk.

### Non-Goals

- Networking (no TCP/IP, no modem)
- Preemptive multitasking (cooperative only)
- Protected mode (real mode for XT compatibility)
- DOS compatibility (different API)

## Ports

The x86 assembly OS above is the reference implementation. UnoDOS also
runs on Motorola 68K platforms, rewritten against the portable contract
in [docs/PORT-SPEC.md](docs/PORT-SPEC.md):

| Port | Target hardware | Approach | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| [**Amiga**](amiga/) | A500-class, OCS/ECS, 68000, 512KB | Bare-metal: self-booting ADF, copper/bitplanes (32 colors), hardware-sprite cursor, 4-channel Paula audio | **Milestone 3+** — cooperative multitasking, writable FAT12 disks (DF1, PC-interchangeable), splash, 11 apps incl. the three games, Tracker and Paint. **Apps load from disk** — 9 `.APP` binaries on the DF1 FAT12 disk are loaded on-open into per-window `$50000` slots and call the kernel through a fixed API vector table at `$77000` (by ordinal); SysInfo/Clock stay kernel-resident, kernel hunk-exe 30620 → 22872 bytes (−25%) |
| [**Mac System 7**](mac/) | Mac II / LC / Quadra (68020+) | Toolbox-based: 8-bit Color QuickDraw (true-RGB game art), Event/File/Sound Managers | **Milestone 3** — cooperative multitasking, PC-compatible FAT12 floppies (data volumes), 11 apps incl. the three games, Tracker and Paint. **Apps load from storage** — the shared `unodos.c` core is now app-free (a runtime `AppInterface` table replaces the compile-time `switch(proc)`) and all 11 apps are separate loadable modules; host-shim-verified, with the native path build-wired to load modules off the FAT12 volume / CODE resource — on-device (Retro68+Executor) verification pending |
| [**Mac System 1–6**](mac/) | Mac Plus / SE / Classic (68000) | Toolbox-based: classic 1-bit QuickDraw, authentic mono theme | **Milestone 3** — same set minus the color-only Theme app (Paint uses the classic dither patterns); same app-free core + disk-loaded modules as the System 7 build |
| [**MacPlus (standalone OS)**](macplus/) | Mac Plus / SE / Classic (68000) + Mac II class (640×480) | Bare-metal: own boot blocks (ROM bootstrap = BIOS, like the x86 port), own vectors/drivers, 1-bit dither renderer, software cursor; **machine-adaptive input** (Plus M0110/SCC quadrature vs. SE/II ROM-assisted ADB); ROM-free Unicorn harness | **Milestone 3** — full app parity (11 apps incl. the three games, Paint, Music, Tracker, Theme), FAT12 filesystem + **disk-loaded apps** (9 `.APP` binaries on the .Sony disk, loaded into 16 KB slots on demand and multi-resident; SysInfo/Clock and the audio sequencers stay kernel-side; kernel 30932 → 16774 bytes, −46%), sound, cooperative scheduler, on top of the M1 desktop/window-manager (System 7 chrome); validated in Mini vMac (real Plus ROM) + Mini vMac II (real IIcx ROM) **and on a real Mac SE (FloppyEmu)** (see [macplus/README](macplus/README.md)) |
| [**Sega Genesis**](genesis/) | Mega Drive / Genesis (68000, 64KB) | Bare-metal cartridge ROM: VDP tile-cell desktop (Paint runs on unique tiles), hardware-sprite cursor + game actors, pad-as-mouse + soft keyboard, PS/2 on the control ports, PSG audio | **Milestone 6+** — 11 apps incl. the three games, Theme, Tracker and Paint, SRAM + tape/WAV + Sega CD backup-RAM storage, cooperative multitasking; **boots and runs on real hardware** (desktop + apps via flashcart, validated 2026-06-12; the PS/2, tape-comparator and Sega CD Mode-1 adapter paths are not yet exercised on metal) |
| [**Apple II**](apple2/) | Apple ][+ / //e (6502 @ 1MHz, 48–64KB), hi-res 280×192 (1-bit, 7px/byte) | Bare-metal: Disk II ROM autoload → own GCR 6-and-2 RWTS (read+write), hi-res software renderer, keyboard window manager, 1-bit `$C030` speaker | **Milestone 3** — desktop + 10 apps (Theme, Dostris, Pac-Man, Music, Tracker, Paint + SysInfo/Clock/Files/Notepad), mini-FS, blocking square-wave audio, OutLast (~4fps prototype) + cooperative-scheduler verdict. **Apps load from disk** — 8 app binaries are read off the disk through the GCR RWTS into a fixed `$6000` full-screen region (SysInfo + Clock stay small kernel-drawn launcher windows); kernel 14669 → 5194 bytes. ROM-free py65 harness-verified (the RWTS load path is the real one, working on hardware), real-hw (AppleWin/FloppyEmu) pending |
| [**Sony PS2**](ps2/) | PlayStation 2 (MIPS R5900 EE, 32MB, Graphics Synthesizer), FreeMcBoot ELF | Port the portable C core ([mac/unodos.c](mac/unodos.c)) over a software 640×448×32 framebuffer blitted to GS each vsync; DualShock 2 + USB keyboard/mouse | **Milestone 3** — the full desktop / WM / all 11 apps (+ FAT12 round-trip, 32-bit Theme) run via the Mac-compat shim over the software FB, verified on the host shim and the **emulated PS2 GS** in PCSX2 (`ps2/shots/m1_pcsx2_pacman.png`); **memory-card storage** persists Files/Notepad across boots via libmc (`ps2/shots/m2_pcsx2_*.png`); **USB keyboard + mouse** (embedded `usbd`/`ps2kbd`/`ps2mouse`, RAW-HID keymap, absolute mouse + GS cursor) and **SPU2 audio via audsrv** (embedded `audsrv.irx`, square-wave synth) — boot verified at 60 fps in PCSX2 with all of it loaded (`ps2/shots/m3_audio_boot.png`), USB/audio function is hardware-only. **Apps load from storage** — the shared `unodos.c` core is now app-free (the `switch(proc)` dispatch became a runtime `AppInterface` table) and all 11 apps are separate loadable modules; host-shim-verified (the app-free core `dlopen`s and renders all 11), with the native path build-wired to load `.uno` modules from `mc0:/UnoDOS/Apps/` — on-device PCSX2 verification pending. Remaining: real hardware |
| [**Sega Dreamcast**](dreamcast/) | Dreamcast (Hitachi SH-4, 16MB, PowerVR2), KallistiOS `.cdi` | Port the same portable C core over a software **640×480×32** framebuffer copied to the DC framebuffer (`vram_s`) as RGB565 each vblank; maple controller + keyboard + mouse, VMU storage, AICA square-wave audio | **At parity — emulator-verified.** The full desktop / WM / all 11 apps (+ 32-bit Theme), **VMU** save/load, and **AICA** audio all run via the Mac-compat shim at native 640×480. Built clean against KallistiOS (`sh-elf-gcc 15.2.0`, from source) into a real SH-4 ELF + bootable `.cdi` (mkdcdisc) and **verified booting at 60 fps in Flycast** — desktop, every app, and the VMU Notepad save→reload round-trip captured (`dreamcast/shots/dc_*.png`). Also host-shim-verified (`dreamcast/shots/m1_*.png`). **Apps load from storage** — the shared `unodos.c` core is now app-free (runtime `AppInterface` table, not a compile-time `switch`) and all 11 apps are separate loadable modules; host-shim-verified, with the native path build-wired to load `.uno` modules from `/cd/UNODOS/APPS/` (ISO9660) — on-device Flycast verification pending. Remaining: real hardware (incl. the audio ear-check) |
| [**Super Nintendo**](snes/) | SNES / Super Famicom (65816 @ 3.58MHz, 128KB WRAM, PPU + SPC700), LoROM cartridge | Bare-metal cartridge: the Genesis port's twin in 65816 on a **shadow + DMA** model (main loop writes a WRAM tilemap shadow, the vblank NMI DMAs it to VRAM), pad-as-pointer + soft keyboard, battery-SRAM mini-FS, **SPC700 audio** (an uploaded driver built by a tiny Python SPC700 assembler) | **Milestones M0–M3 done — emulator-verified.** Tile desktop / WM / cursor / soft keyboard, USV1 SRAM + Notepad/Files, the three games (Dostris, OutLast, Pac-Man), and the M3 set — **Music**, **Theme** (palette shadow → NMI CGRAM flush), **Tracker** (4 DSP voices), **Paint** (a per-pixel **canvas of unique tiles**), and a cooperative **tick-model scheduler** (the 65816 bank-0 stack constraint rules out per-task stacks — a documented verdict). The SPC700 driver is verified by its mailbox ack ("Audio: SPC700 OK"). Every milestone is captured via Mesen2's F12 framebuffer (`snes/build/m*.png`). Deviations + backlog in [snes/HANDOFF.md](snes/HANDOFF.md). Remaining: real hardware + the audio ear-check |
| [**Apple IIGS**](iigs/) | Apple IIGS (65C816 @ 2.8MHz, 256KB–8MB), Super Hi-Res 320×200 (16 of 4096 colors), Ensoniq 5503 DOC, ADB, SmartPort 3.5″ | Bare-metal: ProDOS/SmartPort block-boot → native 65816, a 4bpp **Super Hi-Res** software renderer (kernel state in fast bank 0, the bank-`$E1` framebuffer reached via 24-bit pointers + long stores so DBR never moves), ADB mouse + keyboard, save-under software cursor, FAT12 over the firmware block driver, **Ensoniq DOC** audio | **Full app parity — harness-verified.** SHR desktop / WM / cursor, FAT12 (Files/Notepad, persistent across reboot), all 11 apps incl. the three games, **4096-colour Theme** (one palette poke recolours the whole desktop), **Ensoniq DOC** Music + 4-voice **Tracker**, and a cooperative tick-scheduler. **Apps load from disk** — 8 `.APP` binaries are read at runtime from the FAT12/SmartPort volume into per-app bank-0 slots and dispatched through their loaded JMP vectors, with multiple apps resident at once (3 verified ticking concurrently); SysInfo/Clock stay kernel-resident, kernel 11636 → 6335 bytes. Built and driven entirely by a **from-scratch Python 65C816 core** + ROM-free harness (no IIGS ROM or emulator needed) — 9 regression suites green (`iigs/shots/m3_*.png`). Remaining: real hardware (GSplus/KEGS/MAME by hand, then FloppyEmu SmartPort) + the audio ear-check. See [iigs/HANDOFF.md](iigs/HANDOFF.md) |
| [**Commodore 64**](c64/) | C64 (6510 @ ~1MHz, 64KB), VIC-II hi-res bitmap 320×200 (per-cell colour), SID, CIA | Bare-metal PRG (BASIC stub `SYS 2061` → takes over): banks the VIC into a **hi-res bitmap with per-cell colour from screen RAM** (genuinely 16-colour, not 1-bit), own renderer / WM, **CIA #1 keyboard-matrix** scanner, **CIA Time-of-Day** clock, SID, **PAL/NTSC auto-detect** from the raster; **larger apps load from disk** through a stable kernel API. No KERNAL calls (SEI + poll) | **Milestones M1–M3 — full 11-app parity, harness-verified.** Colour desktop / WM (SysInfo + Clock), USV1 byte-heap mini-FS with Files + Notepad (persisted across a power cycle), and the M3 set: **Theme** (re-tints the whole desktop), **Dostris** (colour tetrominoes), **Music** + **Tracker** on the **three real SID voices**, **Pac-Man**, **Paint** (16-colour canvas) and **OutLast** (colour-band pseudo-3D). **All apps are disk-loaded** — every one is a separate binary on the `.d64`, loaded to `$5000` via the `$DE00` loader port and linked to the kernel only by the API addresses `mkapi.py` extracts; the kernel holds no app code (`.prg` 8603 → 3775 bytes, ~56% smaller). Built with `dasm` → `.prg` + bootable `.d64`; driven by a **ROM-free py65 harness** that models the VIC raster, CIA matrix + TOD, SID, the FS and the app loader, rendering the bitmap to colour PNG (`c64/shots/*.png`). Remaining: real hardware (VICE, then the 1541/IEC drivers behind the FS + app loader, then SD2IEC). See [c64/HANDOFF.md](c64/HANDOFF.md) |

### Built fresh on the 3.1 contract-driven architecture

These **eight** are *not* legacy ports migrated to the Contract — they were written
from scratch against `unodef/` (the Contract generates their screen geometry,
window/event layout, and enums), proving a new target costs a small generated
surface. All are M1–M3 with a **Dostris** game + audio. The four newest are verified
on **ROM-free instruction-level harnesses** (running the real ROM on a CPU core) where
the emulator can't be captured headlessly under RDP.

A feature-by-feature comparison of the mature targets lives in
[docs/FEATURE-MATRIX.md](docs/FEATURE-MATRIX.md). The new-ports program
(Apple II ✓, Sony PS2 ✓, Sega Dreamcast ✓, Apple IIGS ✓, SNES ✓) is tracked in
[docs/PORTS-PLAN.md](docs/PORTS-PLAN.md); the standalone MacPlus OS port
joins the matrix at app parity. The Dreamcast port reuses the PS2 port's
portable-C-core approach almost verbatim — same core, same Mac-compat shim,
swapped present (KallistiOS framebuffer) and input (maple) layers.

### App loading

The x86 reference port has always loaded apps from disk: the launcher itself is
a disk file, and apps are flat binaries the kernel pulls in through **kernel API
#18** (load app) and runs. Every storage-equipped port now follows the same
principle — apps are **separate binaries on disk**, not code compiled into the
kernel, linked to the kernel only by an **extracted API table** (the C64's
`mkapi.py` → `kernel_api.inc` + JMP-vector contract, generalised across the
family). Kernels shrink accordingly (C64 −56%, Apple II to ~⅓, MacPlus −46%,
Amiga −25%, the IIGS roughly halved). Two models are used: RAM-tight 8-bit ports
(C64, Apple II) load **one full-screen app at a time** into a fixed region; the
windowed ports (IIGS, MacPlus, Amiga, and the shared Mac/PS2/Dreamcast C core)
load apps **on open into per-app regions** and keep several resident, dispatching
each window through the app's loaded vectors / `AppInterface` table.

The two **cartridge** consoles — **SNES and Genesis** — are deliberately left
with their apps built into the ROM, because cartridge ROM is the correct
delivery medium and there is no removable or writable code storage to load from.

### 3D graphics — Uno3D

UnoDOS has its own portable 3D graphics library, **Uno3D** ([uno3d/](uno3d/),
guide in [docs/UNO3D.md](docs/UNO3D.md)): a write-once 3D API with a swappable
per-platform rasteriser backend. The same 3D game ("UnoDOS Runner") runs on the
**software** rasteriser (any port), the **PlayStation 2 Graphics Synthesizer**,
and the **Dreamcast PowerVR2** — the two consoles using real hardware
acceleration at 60 fps. The bare-metal x86 OS gets its own native 3D app
([apps/runner3d.asm](apps/runner3d.asm)) that draws through the kernel's `INT
0x80` graphics API. The backend interface is built for more targets (PS3, a
GPU-equipped PC, GameCube, Xbox).

### Cross-platform UI toolkit — unoui

The C-based ports share a portable widget toolkit, **unoui** ([unoui/](unoui/),
guide in [docs/UNOUI.md](docs/UNOUI.md)) — the same write-once / swappable-vtable
idea as Uno3D, applied to look-and-feel. An app builds a window's widget tree
**once** (buttons, checkboxes, tabs, menu bar, slider, spinner, dropdown, list,
single- and multi-line text editors, scrollbars, …); a swappable **theme**
restyles all of it — colours you can change *and* graphics you can override —
and it is depth-aware (1/4/8/full-bit via ordered dither). Eight themes ship,
from the unified UnoDOS look to native reproductions of Mac OS 7, a 1-bit Mac
Plus, Windows 3.1, Amiga Workbench, the C64, the Apple II, and NeXTSTEP. All
interaction (window drag with z-order, focus/Tab, scrollbar and slider thumbs,
menus, multi-line text editing) is a pure function of an abstract event stream,
so a port writes only a tiny adapter mapping its native mouse/keyboard to
`unoui_event` plus the framebuffer present. Host-verified into a theme contact
sheet and a scripted-input storyboard. This is the C-side analogue of the
kernel-native asm widget set documented under **GUI Toolkit** below — see
[docs/UNOUI.md §8](docs/UNOUI.md#8-relationship-to-the-kernel-native-widgets).

The x86 reference build above now runs at **full feature parity on a genuine
Intel 8088 / IBM PC-XT** — for years it had only ever run on QEMU (a 486-class
CPU that hides all real 8088 behaviour). Verified on a cycle-accurate emulated
XT (8088 @ 4.77 MHz, CGA, ROM-free GLaBIOS): boot chain → kernel → CGA desktop
→ window manager + cooperative scheduler → the CGA app set (SysInfo, Settings,
Files, Paint, Clock, Notepad, Music, Tracker, Pac-Man) → FAT12 read/write →
keyboard (XT 8255 PPI) and a **Microsoft serial mouse on COM1** (a real XT has
no PS/2 port). It also **boots from a CompactFlash card on an XT-IDE adapter**
(a FAT12 "superfloppy" CF, since the FAT16 hard-disk path is 386-only — full
FAT16-on-8088 is a follow-up). VGA apps are out-of-envelope on a CGA machine,
and a physical-XT pass is the final hardware step. See
[docs/PORT-8088.md](docs/PORT-8088.md) and [tools/xt/](tools/xt/).

All ports boot through a platform-themed **"UnoDOS 3" splash** (striped
checkmark on Amiga, happy compact Mac, IBM PC art on x86) into the
UnoDOS desktop: window manager (z-order, drag, click-to-raise), the
focus-routed event model, and the shared app set — **Files** (with
subdirectory navigation on Mac), **Notepad** (caret editor, line
navigation, live Ln/Co/bytes status bar), **Music** (Canon in D),
**Theme** (8 shared preset palettes + custom colors on every
color-capable platform), **Tracker** (the 32x4 pattern editor with a
byte-identical song format on every platform), **Paint** (the
MacPaint-style editor whose color selector reaches each platform's
full gamut), and the game ports **Dostris**, **OutLast** and
**Pac-Man** with their music. Verified in WinUAE (built-in AROS ROM)
and the ROM-free Executor emulator — no proprietary ROMs needed to
try them.

## Screenshots

*Screenshots coming soon — the OS runs in CGA 320x200 (4-color) and VGA 320x200 (256-color) modes.*

## Features

### Display Modes

UnoDOS supports four video modes, switchable at runtime from the Settings app:

| Mode | Resolution | Colors | Bits/Pixel | Memory |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|--------|
| CGA Mode 4 | 320x200 | 4 | 2 (interlaced) | 0xB800 |
| VGA Mode 13h | 320x200 | 256 | 8 (linear) | 0xA000 |
| VGA Mode 12h | 640x480 | 16 | 4 (planar) | 0xA000 |
| VESA | 640x480 | 256 | 8 (banked) | 0xA000 |

All drawing APIs, widgets, and applications work across all four modes. Higher resolutions automatically scale window content 2x for readability.

### Kernel & System Calls

The kernel provides 106 API functions accessed via `INT 0x80` with the function index in AH. The API covers:

- **Graphics** (APIs 0-6, 67-71, 80, 94, 102-104): Pixel, rectangle, filled rectangle, character, string, inverted string, clear area, colored drawing, horizontal/vertical/Bresenham lines, scroll area, 1-bit sprite drawing, scaled sprite (nearest-neighbor), screen blit (region copy), pixel read
- **Fonts** (APIs 33, 48-49, 93): Three built-in bitmap fonts (4x6 small, 8x8 default, 8x14 large) with runtime selection, text width measurement, and font metrics query
- **Window Manager** (APIs 20-25, 31-32, 64, 78-79, 96-97): Create, destroy, draw, focus, move, resize windows; drawing context for window-relative coordinates; window info query; content area size; content scaling
- **Widgets** (APIs 50-62, 65-66, 87-89, 98-99): Button, radio button, checkbox, text input field, scrollbar (with drag hit-testing), list item, progress bar, group box, separator, combo box, menu bar, word-wrapped text, popup context menus, system file open/save dialogs

### Window Manager

- **16 concurrent windows** with z-ordered rendering and per-pixel clipping
- Title bars with app name, borders, and close button [X]
- **Outline drag** — XOR rectangle follows the mouse during drag, window moves on release (Windows 3.1 style)
- **Resize** — drag handle in the bottom-right corner (10x10 hit zone), minimum 60x40 pixels
- **Active/inactive distinction** — focused window gets a highlighted title bar; background windows are dimmed
- **Drawing context** — apps call `win_begin_draw` and then draw at (0,0) meaning top-left of the content area. The kernel auto-translates coordinates to absolute screen position for all drawing, widget, sprite, and menu APIs
- **Content scaling** — in 640x480 modes, windows auto-scale content 2x so apps designed for 320x200 remain usable
- **Z-order clipping** — drawing calls from background windows are silently blocked; apps repaint on focus via WIN_REDRAW events
- **Cursor protection** — the kernel automatically hides/shows the mouse cursor around all drawing operations to prevent XOR corruption from IRQ12

### GUI Toolkit

A complete widget library, all coordinate-translated through the drawing context:

| Widget | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Button | Raised/pressed states with centered text label |
| Radio Button | Circular selector with fill indicator |
| Checkbox | Square toggle with check mark |
| Text Field | Text input with cursor, selection, and password mode |
| Scrollbar | Vertical/horizontal with draggable thumb, arrows, and track hit-testing |
| List Item | Row with text, optional selection highlight |
| Progress Bar | Fill indicator with percentage text |
| Group Box | Labeled frame for grouping controls |
| Separator | Horizontal or vertical divider line |
| Combo Box | Dropdown selector |
| Menu Bar | Horizontal menu items with padding and hit zones |
| Popup Menu | Context menu with item list and mouse hit-testing |
| File Open Dialog | Modal dialog with scrollable file list, keyboard/mouse nav, Open/Cancel |
| File Save Dialog | Modal dialog with filename text field, file list, overwrite confirmation |
| Word Wrap | Multi-line text rendering with automatic line breaking |

### Desktop

- **Icon grid** — apps discovered from disk, displayed with 16x16 bitmap icons (32x32 scaled in high-res modes)
- **Drag icons** — click and hold to reposition icons on the desktop
- **Lock/unlock** — prevent accidental icon rearrangement
- **Right-click context menu** — Auto Arrange, Sort A-Z, Sort Z-A, Lock/Unlock Icons, Refresh, Exit
- **Keyboard navigation** — arrow keys or WASD to select icons, Enter to launch
- **Double-click launch** — 0.5-second threshold using BIOS timer
- **Boot media auto-detection** — launcher queries the boot drive and mounts the correct filesystem (FAT12 for floppy, FAT16 for HD/CF/USB)

### Filesystem

Two filesystem drivers with a unified API that routes by mount handle:

**FAT12 (Floppy)**:
- 1.44MB floppy disk support
- 12-bit FAT entries, dual FAT copies
- Full read/write: mount, open, read, write, create, delete, rename, seek, readdir
- Settings persistence (SETTINGS.CFG loaded at boot)

**FAT16 (Hard Drive)**:
- 64MB partition with MBR and partition table
- 16-bit FAT entries (256 per sector), dual FAT copies
- Multi-sector cluster support
- LBA access with CHS fallback for older BIOSes (PCMCIA CF cards)
- Full read/write with same API as FAT12

### Multitasking

- **Cooperative round-robin scheduler** — apps yield control with `app_yield`, kernel switches to next runnable task
- **Up to 5 concurrent user apps** plus the launcher shell (6 total)
- **Dynamic segment allocation** — each app loads into its own 64KB segment from a pool (0x3000-0x7000)
- **Per-task state** — the kernel saves and restores registers, stack pointer, draw context, font selection, and caller segments on every context switch
- **Focus-aware input** — only the focused app receives keyboard events; mouse events go to the appropriate window owner
- **Automatic cleanup** — when an app exits, its windows are destroyed, speaker is silenced, and its segment is freed

### Input

**Keyboard:**
- Custom INT 09h handler (not BIOS INT 16h) with scan code translation
- 16-byte key buffer with per-task event delivery
- Modifier tracking: Shift, Ctrl, Alt states queryable via API

**Mouse:**
- Primary: BIOS INT 15h/C2 services (works with USB mice via BIOS legacy emulation)
- Fallback: Direct KBC port I/O with IRQ12 for BIOSes without INT 15h/C2 support
- **IBM PC/XT: Microsoft serial mouse on COM1** (IRQ4) — a real XT has no PS/2
  port; on a pre-AT machine the kernel programs the COM1 UART (1200/7N1),
  detects the mouse via its `'M'` identifier, and decodes the 3-byte protocol
  in an IRQ4 handler (verified on a cycle-accurate 8088 — see [docs/PORT-8088.md](docs/PORT-8088.md))
- XOR sprite cursor (8x8) with automatic hide/show during drawing
- Boot-time auto-detection with diagnostic letter: B (BIOS), K (KBC), C (COM serial), E (no mouse)

### Audio

PC speaker tone generation via PIT Channel 2 — specify frequency in Hz. The speaker is automatically silenced when an app exits. Used by the Music app (5 classical pieces) and Dostris (Korobeiniki background music).

### Boot Chain

**Floppy boot**: Boot sector (512 bytes) loads Stage 2 (2KB), which loads the kernel (104 sectors / 52KB reserved area) with a progress indicator. Each stage verifies a magic signature before transferring control.

**Hard drive boot**: MBR relocates to 0x0600, reads VBR from the first partition, VBR loads Stage 2, Stage 2 parses the FAT16 BPB and loads KERNEL.BIN from the filesystem. Supports both LBA (INT 13h extensions) and CHS fallback, with diagnostic output showing the read method and root directory LBA.

**Boot media**: 1.44MB floppy, hard drive, CompactFlash (PCMCIA or IDE), USB flash drive — anything the BIOS can boot from.

### Settings Persistence

The Settings app saves user preferences to SETTINGS.CFG on the boot drive:
- Font selection (4x6 / 8x8 / 8x14)
- Color theme (text color, desktop background, window frame color)
- Video mode (CGA / VGA 320x200 / VGA 640x480 / VESA 640x480)
- Real-time clock adjustment

Settings are loaded automatically at boot before the launcher starts.

### Fonts

Three built-in bitmap fonts, selectable per-app at runtime:

| Font | Size | Advance | Chars/Line (320px) | Use |
|------|------|---------|--------------------|-----|
| Font 0 | 4x6 | 6px | 53 | Small labels, status bars |
| Font 1 | 8x8 | 12px | 26 | Default body text |
| Font 2 | 8x14 | 12px | 26 | Large headings |

### Sprites & Blitting

- **1-bit sprite drawing** — transparent bitmap with caller-specified color, any width/height
- **Scaled sprite** — nearest-neighbor scaling to arbitrary destination size
- **Screen blit** — copy a rectangular region of the screen (used for smooth scrolling, animations)
- **Read pixel** — query the color value at any screen coordinate

## Building

### Requirements

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
```bash
sudo apt install nasm qemu-system-x86 make python3
```

### Build Commands

```bash
# Build 1.44MB floppy image (OS + all apps)
make floppy144

# Build app-only launcher floppy
make apps && make build/launcher-floppy.img

# Build 64MB hard drive image (FAT16)
make hd-image

# Run in QEMU (floppy)
make run144

# Run in QEMU (hard drive)
make run-hd

# Clean build artifacts
make clean
```

### Build Output

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `build/unodos-144.img` | 1.44MB boot floppy (FAT12, OS + apps) |
| `build/launcher-floppy.img` | Apps-only floppy image |
| `build/unodos-hd.img` | 64MB bootable hard drive image (FAT16) |
| `build/*.bin` | Individual compiled binaries |

### Pre-built Images

Pre-built disk images are included in the `build/` directory for users who can't build from source. Just clone the repo and write the image to media.

## Writing to Physical Media

### Windows (PowerShell, Run as Administrator)

```powershell
# Interactive mode — select image and target drive:
.\tools\write.ps1

# Quick floppy write:
.\tools\write.ps1 -DriveLetter A

# Quick HD/CF/USB write:
.\tools\write.ps1 -DiskNumber 2
```

The write tool auto-detects available drives, excludes system drives for safety, and includes optional read-back verification (`-Verify` flag).

### Linux

```bash
# Floppy
sudo dd if=build/unodos-144.img of=/dev/fd0 bs=512

# USB/CF (replace sdX with your device)
sudo dd if=build/unodos-hd.img of=/dev/sdX bs=512
```

## Writing Your Own App

UnoDOS apps are flat `.BIN` binaries assembled with NASM. Each app runs in its own 64KB segment and communicates with the kernel through `INT 0x80` system calls. Here's a minimal windowed app:

```asm
[BITS 16]
[ORG 0x0000]

; 80-byte icon header (JMP + magic + name + 16x16 bitmap)
    db 0xEB, 0x4E                   ; JMP to code entry at 0x50
    db 'UI'                         ; Magic identifier
    db 'MyApp', 0                   ; Display name (12 bytes max)
    times (0x04 + 12) - ($ - $$) db 0
    times 64 db 0xFF               ; 16x16 icon (placeholder: solid white)
    times 0x50 - ($ - $$) db 0

; Code entry (offset 0x50)
entry:
    ; Save registers (8086-safe: PUSHA is a 186+ instruction and silently
    ; executes as JO on an 8088 - see kernel/cpu8086.inc for macros)
    push ax
    push bx
    push cx
    push dx
    push si
    push di
    push bp
    push ds
    push es
    mov ax, cs
    mov ds, ax                      ; DS = our segment

    ; Create a window (200x60 at position 60,60)
    mov bx, 60
    mov cx, 60
    mov dx, 200
    mov si, 60
    mov ax, cs
    mov es, ax
    mov di, title
    mov al, 0x03                    ; Title bar + border
    mov ah, 20                      ; win_create
    int 0x80
    jc .exit                        ; CF=1 = no free window slots

    mov ah, 31                      ; win_begin_draw (window-relative coords)
    int 0x80

    ; Draw text at (10,10) inside the window
    mov bx, 10
    mov cx, 10
    mov si, msg
    mov ah, 4                       ; gfx_draw_string
    int 0x80

    ; Event loop — wait for ESC
.loop:
    sti                             ; Re-enable interrupts (INT clears IF)
    mov ah, 9                       ; event_get (non-blocking)
    int 0x80
    jc .loop                        ; No event, keep polling
    cmp al, 1                       ; KEY_PRESS?
    jne .loop
    cmp dl, 27                      ; ESC?
    jne .loop

.exit:
    pop es
    pop ds
    pop bp
    pop di
    pop si
    pop dx
    pop cx
    pop bx
    pop ax
    xor ax, ax
    retf                            ; Return to kernel

title: db 'MyApp', 0
msg:   db 'Hello, UnoDOS!', 0
```

Assemble with `nasm -f bin -o MYAPP.BIN app.asm`, place in the FAT filesystem, and it appears on the desktop with its icon. See the [App Development Guide](docs/APP_DEVELOPMENT.md) for the full tutorial covering windows, events, mouse input, file I/O, widgets, fonts, and audio.
