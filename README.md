# UnoDOS 3

A graphical operating system for IBM PC XT-compatible computers, written entirely in x86 assembly language.

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-CC%20BY--NC%204.0-blue)

## Overview

UnoDOS 3 is a GUI-first operating system that boots directly into a windowed desktop environment. It runs on bare metal x86 hardware with no DOS dependency — just BIOS services and an Intel 8088 or later processor. The entire OS, including a ~46KB kernel (loaded from a 104-sector / 52KB reserved area) with 105 system calls, a window manager, two filesystems, cooperative multitasking, and 16 applications, fits on a single 1.44MB floppy disk.

### Philosophy

- **GUI-First**: No command line. The system boots directly into a graphical desktop with draggable icons, windows, and mouse support.
- **Bare Metal**: Runs on raw hardware using only BIOS services. No DOS, no runtime, no dependencies.
- **Vintage-Friendly**: Designed for the constraints of 1980s hardware — runs on an original IBM PC with 128KB RAM and a CGA card.
- **Self-Contained**: The kernel, window manager, GUI toolkit, filesystem drivers, and all 16 applications fit on one floppy disk.

## Screenshots

*Screenshots coming soon — the OS runs in CGA 320x200 (4-color) and VGA 320x200 (256-color) modes.*

## Features

### Display Modes

UnoDOS supports four video modes, switchable at runtime from the Settings app:

| Mode | Resolution | Colors | Bits/Pixel | Memory |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|--------|
| CGA Mode 4 | 320x200 | 4 | 2 (interlaced) | 0xB800 |
| VGA Mode 13h | 320x200 | 256 | 8 (linear) | 0xA000 |
| VGA Mode 12h | 640x480 | 16 | 4 (planar) | 0xA000 |
| VESA | 640x480 | 256 | 8 (banked) | 0xA000 |

All drawing APIs, widgets, and applications work across all four modes. Higher resolutions automatically scale window content 2x for readability.

### Kernel & System Calls

The kernel provides 105 API functions accessed via `INT 0x80` with the function index in AH. The API covers:

- **Graphics** (APIs 0-6, 67-71, 80, 94, 102-104): Pixel, rectangle, filled rectangle, character, string, inverted string, clear area, colored drawing, horizontal/vertical/Bresenham lines, scroll area, 1-bit sprite drawing, scaled sprite (nearest-neighbor), screen blit (region copy), pixel read
- **Fonts** (APIs 33, 48-49, 93): Three built-in bitmap fonts (4x6 small, 8x8 default, 8x14 large) with runtime selection, text width measurement, and font metrics query
- **Window Manager** (APIs 20-25, 31-32, 64, 78-79, 96-97): Create, destroy, draw, focus, move, resize windows; drawing context for window-relative coordinates; window info query; content area size; content scaling
- **Widgets** (APIs 50-62, 65-66, 87-89, 98-99): Button, radio button, checkbox, text input field, scrollbar (with drag hit-testing), list item, progress bar, group box, separator, combo box, menu bar, word-wrapped text, popup context menus, system file open/save dialogs
- **Events** (APIs 9-10): Non-blocking and blocking event retrieval from a 32-entry circular queue. Event types: KEY_PRESS, KEY_RELEASE, TIMER, MOUSE, WIN_MOVED, WIN_REDRAW
- **Filesystem** (APIs 13-16, 27, 40, 44-47, 75-77): Mount, open, read, write, create, delete, close, readdir, seek, rename, file size query, raw sector write, BIN header read — for both FAT12 (floppy) and FAT16 (hard drive)
- **Input** (APIs 28-30, 83, 101): Mouse state (position + buttons), mouse positioning, mouse detection, keyboard modifier state (Shift/Ctrl/Alt), mouse cursor visibility
- **Clipboard** (APIs 84-86): System-wide 4KB clipboard with copy, paste, and length query — shared between all running apps
- **Audio** (APIs 41-42): PC speaker tone generation (frequency in Hz) and silence, via PIT Channel 2
- **Multitasking** (APIs 18-19, 34-36, 74): Load app, run app (blocking), yield to scheduler, start app (non-blocking), exit task, task info query
- **System** (APIs 43, 63, 72-73, 81-82, 95): Boot drive detection, tick counter, RTC read/write (BCD), delay with yield, screen info, video mode switching
- **Themes** (APIs 54-55): Set/get color theme (text, desktop background, window frame colors)
- **Memory** (APIs 7-8): Heap allocation and free (first-fit allocator)
- **Desktop** (APIs 37-39): Desktop icon registration, icon clearing, 16x16 icon rendering

### Window Manager

- **16 concurrent windows** with z-ordered rendering and per-pixel clipping
- Title bars with app name, borders, and close button [X]
- **Outline drag** — XOR rectangle follows the mouse during drag, window moves on release (Windows 3.1 style)
- **Resize** — drag handle in the bottom-right corner (10x10 hit zone), minimum 60x40 pixels
- **Active/inactive distinction** — focused window gets a highlighted title bar; background windows are dimmed
- **Drawing context** — apps call `win_begin_draw` and then draw at (0,0) meaning top-left of the content area. The kernel auto-translates coordinates to absolute screen position for all drawing, widget, sprite, and menu APIs
- **Content scaling** — in 640x480 modes, windows auto-scale content 2x so apps designed for 320x200 remain usable
- **Z-order clipping** — drawing calls from background windows are silently blocked; apps repaint on focus via WIN_REDRAW events
- **Cursor protection** — the kernel automatically hides/shows the mouse cursor around all drawing operations to prevent XOR corruption from IRQ12

### GUI Toolkit

A complete widget library, all coordinate-translated through the drawing context:

| Widget | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Button | Raised/pressed states with centered text label |
| Radio Button | Circular selector with fill indicator |
| Checkbox | Square toggle with check mark |
| Text Field | Text input with cursor, selection, and password mode |
| Scrollbar | Vertical/horizontal with draggable thumb, arrows, and track hit-testing |
| List Item | Row with text, optional selection highlight |
| Progress Bar | Fill indicator with percentage text |
| Group Box | Labeled frame for grouping controls |
| Separator | Horizontal or vertical divider line |
| Combo Box | Dropdown selector |
| Menu Bar | Horizontal menu items with padding and hit zones |
| Popup Menu | Context menu with item list and mouse hit-testing |
| File Open Dialog | Modal dialog with scrollable file list, keyboard/mouse nav, Open/Cancel |
| File Save Dialog | Modal dialog with filename text field, file list, overwrite confirmation |
| Word Wrap | Multi-line text rendering with automatic line breaking |

### Desktop

- **Icon grid** — apps discovered from disk, displayed with 16x16 bitmap icons (32x32 scaled in high-res modes)
- **Drag icons** — click and hold to reposition icons on the desktop
- **Lock/unlock** — prevent accidental icon rearrangement
- **Right-click context menu** — Auto Arrange, Sort A-Z, Sort Z-A, Lock/Unlock Icons, Refresh, Exit
- **Keyboard navigation** — arrow keys or WASD to select icons, Enter to launch
- **Double-click launch** — 0.5-second threshold using BIOS timer
- **Boot media auto-detection** — launcher queries the boot drive and mounts the correct filesystem (FAT12 for floppy, FAT16 for HD/CF/USB)

### Filesystem

Two filesystem drivers with a unified API that routes by mount handle:

**FAT12 (Floppy)**:
- 1.44MB floppy disk support
- 12-bit FAT entries, dual FAT copies
- Full read/write: mount, open, read, write, create, delete, rename, seek, readdir
- Settings persistence (SETTINGS.CFG loaded at boot)

**FAT16 (Hard Drive)**:
- 64MB partition with MBR and partition table
- 16-bit FAT entries (256 per sector), dual FAT copies
- Multi-sector cluster support
- LBA access with CHS fallback for older BIOSes (PCMCIA CF cards)
- Full read/write with same API as FAT12

### Multitasking

- **Cooperative round-robin scheduler** — apps yield control with `app_yield`, kernel switches to next runnable task
- **Up to 5 concurrent user apps** plus the launcher shell (6 total)
- **Dynamic segment allocation** — each app loads into its own 64KB segment from a pool (0x3000-0x7000)
- **Per-task state** — the kernel saves and restores registers, stack pointer, draw context, font selection, and caller segments on every context switch
- **Focus-aware input** — only the focused app receives keyboard events; mouse events go to the appropriate window owner
- **Automatic cleanup** — when an app exits, its windows are destroyed, speaker is silenced, and its segment is freed

### Input

**Keyboard:**
- Custom INT 09h handler (not BIOS INT 16h) with scan code translation
- 16-byte key buffer with per-task event delivery
- Modifier tracking: Shift, Ctrl, Alt states queryable via API

**Mouse:**
- Primary: BIOS INT 15h/C2 services (works with USB mice via BIOS legacy emulation)
- Fallback: Direct KBC port I/O with IRQ12 for BIOSes without INT 15h/C2 support
- XOR sprite cursor (8x8) with automatic hide/show during drawing
- Boot-time auto-detection with diagnostic letter: B (BIOS), K (KBC), E (no mouse)

### Audio

PC speaker tone generation via PIT Channel 2 — specify frequency in Hz. The speaker is automatically silenced when an app exits. Used by the Music app (5 classical pieces) and Dostris (Korobeiniki background music).

### Boot Chain

**Floppy boot**: Boot sector (512 bytes) loads Stage 2 (2KB), which loads the kernel (104 sectors / 52KB reserved area) with a progress indicator. Each stage verifies a magic signature before transferring control.

**Hard drive boot**: MBR relocates to 0x0600, reads VBR from the first partition, VBR loads Stage 2, Stage 2 parses the FAT16 BPB and loads KERNEL.BIN from the filesystem. Supports both LBA (INT 13h extensions) and CHS fallback, with diagnostic output showing the read method and root directory LBA.

**Boot media**: 1.44MB floppy, hard drive, CompactFlash (PCMCIA or IDE), USB flash drive — anything the BIOS can boot from.

### Settings Persistence

The Settings app saves user preferences to SETTINGS.CFG on the boot drive:
- Font selection (4x6 / 8x8 / 8x14)
- Color theme (text color, desktop background, window frame color)
- Video mode (CGA / VGA 320x200 / VGA 640x480 / VESA 640x480)
- Real-time clock adjustment

Settings are loaded automatically at boot before the launcher starts.

### Fonts

Three built-in bitmap fonts, selectable per-app at runtime:

| Font | Size | Advance | Chars/Line (320px) | Use |
|------|------|---------|--------------------|-----|
| Font 0 | 4x6 | 6px | 53 | Small labels, status bars |
| Font 1 | 8x8 | 12px | 26 | Default body text |
| Font 2 | 8x14 | 12px | 26 | Large headings |

### Sprites & Blitting

- **1-bit sprite drawing** — transparent bitmap with caller-specified color, any width/height
- **Scaled sprite** — nearest-neighbor scaling to arbitrary destination size
- **Screen blit** — copy a rectangular region of the screen (used for smooth scrolling, animations)
- **Read pixel** — query the color value at any screen coordinate

## Building

### Requirements

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
```bash
sudo apt install nasm qemu-system-x86 make python3
```

### Build Commands

```bash
# Build 1.44MB floppy image (OS + all apps)
make floppy144

# Build app-only launcher floppy
make apps && make build/launcher-floppy.img

# Build 64MB hard drive image (FAT16)
make hd-image

# Run in QEMU (floppy)
make run144

# Run in QEMU (hard drive)
make run-hd

# Clean build artifacts
make clean
```

### Build Output

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `build/unodos-144.img` | 1.44MB boot floppy (FAT12, OS + apps) |
| `build/launcher-floppy.img` | Apps-only floppy image |
| `build/unodos-hd.img` | 64MB bootable hard drive image (FAT16) |
| `build/*.bin` | Individual compiled binaries |

### Pre-built Images

Pre-built disk images are included in the `build/` directory for users who can't build from source. Just clone the repo and write the image to media.

## Writing to Physical Media

### Windows (PowerShell, Run as Administrator)

```powershell
# Interactive mode — select image and target drive:
.\tools\write.ps1

# Quick floppy write:
.\tools\write.ps1 -DriveLetter A

# Quick HD/CF/USB write:
.\tools\write.ps1 -DiskNumber 2
```

The write tool auto-detects available drives, excludes system drives for safety, and includes optional read-back verification (`-Verify` flag).

### Linux

```bash
# Floppy
sudo dd if=build/unodos-144.img of=/dev/fd0 bs=512

# USB/CF (replace sdX with your device)
sudo dd if=build/unodos-hd.img of=/dev/sdX bs=512
```

## Writing Your Own App

UnoDOS apps are flat `.BIN` binaries assembled with NASM. Each app runs in its own 64KB segment and communicates with the kernel through `INT 0x80` system calls. Here's a minimal windowed app:

```asm
[BITS 16]
[ORG 0x0000]

; 80-byte icon header (JMP + magic + name + 16x16 bitmap)
    db 0xEB, 0x4E                   ; JMP to code entry at 0x50
    db 'UI'                         ; Magic identifier
    db 'MyApp', 0                   ; Display name (12 bytes max)
    times (0x04 + 12) - ($ - $$) db 0
    times 64 db 0xFF               ; 16x16 icon (placeholder: solid white)
    times 0x50 - ($ - $$) db 0

; Code entry (offset 0x50)
entry:
    ; Save registers (8086-safe: PUSHA is a 186+ instruction and silently
    ; executes as JO on an 8088 - see kernel/cpu8086.inc for macros)
    push ax
    push bx
    push cx
    push dx
    push si
    push di
    push bp
    push ds
    push es
    mov ax, cs
    mov ds, ax                      ; DS = our segment

    ; Create a window (200x60 at position 60,60)
    mov bx, 60
    mov cx, 60
    mov dx, 200
    mov si, 60
    mov ax, cs
    mov es, ax
    mov di, title
    mov al, 0x03                    ; Title bar + border
    mov ah, 20                      ; win_create
    int 0x80
    jc .exit                        ; CF=1 = no free window slots

    mov ah, 31                      ; win_begin_draw (window-relative coords)
    int 0x80

    ; Draw text at (10,10) inside the window
    mov bx, 10
    mov cx, 10
    mov si, msg
    mov ah, 4                       ; gfx_draw_string
    int 0x80

    ; Event loop — wait for ESC
.loop:
    sti                             ; Re-enable interrupts (INT clears IF)
    mov ah, 9                       ; event_get (non-blocking)
    int 0x80
    jc .loop                        ; No event, keep polling
    cmp al, 1                       ; KEY_PRESS?
    jne .loop
    cmp dl, 27                      ; ESC?
    jne .loop

.exit:
    pop es
    pop ds
    pop bp
    pop di
    pop si
    pop dx
    pop cx
    pop bx
    pop ax
    xor ax, ax
    retf                            ; Return to kernel

title: db 'MyApp', 0
msg:   db 'Hello, UnoDOS!', 0
```

Assemble with `nasm -f bin -o MYAPP.BIN app.asm`, place in the FAT filesystem, and it appears on the desktop with its icon. See the [App Development Guide](docs/APP_DEVELOPMENT.md) for the full tutorial covering windows, events, mouse input, file I/O, widgets, fonts, and audio.
